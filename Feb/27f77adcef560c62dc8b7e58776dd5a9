Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride is testifying at the state capture inquiry. McBride is set to give evidence on the role of the police in aiding and covering up state capture. In September, the Sunday Times reported on new claims about a mysterious Russian-trained police death squad that may have been involved in political assassinations, break-ins and harassment during the Zuma presidency. McBride is expected to tell the commission he is investigating the whereabouts and activities of the squad, which was trained in "offensive warfare". This included sniper training, the use of rocket launchers and ambushes. McBride told the Sunday Times that in late 2016, 16 men were hired on the pretext of guarding offices of the Hawks, but were sent for specialist training to Russia. Weapons training might also have been conducted in China, he said.
