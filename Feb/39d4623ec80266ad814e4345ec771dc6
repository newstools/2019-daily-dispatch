Alleluia International Ministries leader Alph Lukau is known for his lavish lifestyle which can be seen on social media where he posts pictures of private jets and flashy cars. Among his collection of toys are a Range Rover, a Bentley, a Lamborghini, a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari and a three-wheeler custom bike. In 2016, Lukau courted controversy when he held a marriage conference where he allegedly charged women up to R5,000 to find husbands. Lukau has a huge social media following with 89,000 Instagram followers and more than 21,000 on Twitter where he displays his opulence. His church, which was established on February 24 2002, celebrated its 17th anniversary on Sunday. The church has 95,000 members in Namibia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Europe and South America. In 2014 the City of Johannesburg had to intervene and close the construction of the church's Lyndhurst building due to safety reasons. The church had been operating on the property while building an additional section despite the fact that the area was not zoned as a place of worship. The church in Johannesburg currently runs services from Kramerville in Sandton.
