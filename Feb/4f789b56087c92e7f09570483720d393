How often do you get Business Day editor Lukanyo Mnyanda, Business Times editor Ron Derby and Financial Mail editor Rob Rose in the room at the same time? Tiso Blackstar’s top business editors get together and talk about what you can expect to hear in the 2019 budget speech. Anchored by Sunday Times reporter Mudiwa Gavaza, the editors delve into the budget’s most pertinent issues, including tax, healthcare, education and training, and the country’s embattled state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The editors are supported by commentary from Rob Cooper, Sage tax expert and chair of the Payroll Authors Group of SA, and Section 27 education attorney Samantha Brener. Have a listen.
