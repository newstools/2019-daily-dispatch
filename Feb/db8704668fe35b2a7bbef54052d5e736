The Western Cape high court has sentenced Jason Rohde to an effective 20 years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife Susan. The former property mogal was convicted in November last year of murdering his wife Susan at an event at Spier wine estate in Stellenbosch in 2016. In handing down the sentence on Wednesday, judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe said that Rohde had used Susan's body as a showroom to "stage" the impression that she had killed herself. "I did not find an acknowledgement that she was your wife, the mother of your children. Naked and stripped of her dignity, you dragged her to the bathroom and inflicted more pain." Rohde's counsel, Graham van der Spuy, said: "We have already received instructions to apply for leave to appeal."
