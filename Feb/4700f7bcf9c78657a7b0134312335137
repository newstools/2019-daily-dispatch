A 23-year-old man wanted for allegedly pointing a firearm, assault and reckless driving attacked police when they tried to arrest him at home in Cape Town. The man had managed to evade arrest until police arrived at his house – a known hangout for a local gang - in Ventura Street, Kensington, on Friday. “During his arrest he assaulted two of our members,” said a statement by police spokesperson Lt-Col Andrè Traut. “He also instigated his fellow gang members to attack police and assist him to evade his arrest. During the violence that erupted, warning shots were fired by police to prevent the suspect from being freed.” Police said the man was also considered to be a “person of interest in an attempted murder investigation”. He was expected to appear in court on Monday to face the original charges and an additional charge for assaulting a police officer. “Gangsters who are of the opinion that Saps will be intimidated by their violent behaviour to prevent the arrest of a suspect must reconsider,” said Traut.
