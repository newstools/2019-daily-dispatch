A sick Eastern Cape prisoner died hours after being kicked out of prison hospital for smoking inside a ward. Provincial correctional services spokesperson Nobuntu Gantana confirmed that Truman Mlamleli, 35, died on March 22 after he was sent back to his prison cell earlier that day. “The inmate was taken out of the hospital section for disobedience as he continued to smoke inside the hospital even though he was told on numerous occasions that it is against hospital rules to do so.” This comes after prisoners called Daily Dispatch claiming that  officials had refused to treat Mlamleli, saying he was faking the illness. This allegation, however, was flatly denied by Gantana. “The allegations of negligence and deliberate deprivation of treatment are not true. The inmate died of natural causes as recorded on the death certificate.” A friend of the deceased Wandile Tunzana, 36, said  Mlamleli was transferred to their cell unit, which housed 40 inmates. “Instead of taking him to hospital, they transferred him from a smokers' communal cell he shared with 37 people, to this non-smokers' communal cell,” Tunzana said. He said he had asked the warders whether they think his cell was a hospital. “They ignored me and dumped him here. The man died at 2am in the morning.” malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
