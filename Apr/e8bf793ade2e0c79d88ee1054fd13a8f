Nelson Mandela Bay ANC Councillor Andile Lungisa today lost his high court appeal against both his conviction and effective two-year prison sentence for assault with intent to grievous bodily harm. The ANC political heavyweight was convicted of assault GBH after smashing a glass water jug on the head of DA Councillor Rano Kayser during a heated NMB council meeting in council chambers in October 2016. Kayser was seriously injured. Port Elizabeth Magistrate Morne Cannon sentenced Lungisa to three years’ imprisonment, with one year conditionally suspended. Judge Judith Roberson with Judge Feziwe Renqe agreeing today dismissed Lungisa’s appeal against both his conviction and sentence. The bottom line of the judgment was read out in the Grahamstown High Court at 9.30am by Judge Murray Lowe. Lungisa was not in court. He was also not answering his phone. Because the matter was decided by two high court judges, Lungisa’s only avenue of appeal will be to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal for special leave.
