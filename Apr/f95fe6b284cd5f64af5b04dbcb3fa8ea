The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in the Free State is standing firm on its decision to burn copies of the book Gangster State: Unravelling Magashule's Web of Capture, despite massive backlash. The ANCYL in the province where Ace Magashule was premier say they are planning on burning copies of the book written by Pieter-Louis Myburgh at Mangaung's dumping site on Monday.ANCYL Free State spokesperson Sello Peterson said in an interview on Radio 702: "We are going to burn that book because we view it as rubbish and garbage. That is why we deliberately chose to take it to the dumping site because that is where it belongs." The book details corruption allegations against Magashule during his tenure as the premier of the Free State. Some of the claims include a R230m "asbestos audit" and how "Mr 10%" got his share from every government tender in the province.Â A launch for the book which was held in Sandton on Tuesday turned chaotic after it was disrupted by a group of people wearing ANC shirts and holding Magashule posters. The ANC has released a statement condemning the disruptions and the book burning plans. The Youth League received much backlash, with some questioning the party's stance on censorship.
