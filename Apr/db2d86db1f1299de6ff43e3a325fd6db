Madiba-Zuma said loving her husband was easy and described him as the kindest person she knows. "I wish you a wonderful day today my love. I'm proud to have such a caring husband. Darling‚ today is your day." ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has also taken to Twitter to express well-wishes for Zuma‚ coining the hash tag #ZumaDay. The social media platform has been filled with messages of support from Zuma loyalists‚ who have called him a "true leader" despite the many allegations of his involvement in state capture.
