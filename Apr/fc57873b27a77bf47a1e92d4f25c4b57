The Hawks have launched a manhunt for a man who allegedly defrauded Eskom out of more than a million rands. Michael Chimanzi, 56, allegedly defrauded the embattled power utility out of approximately R1.3m. Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the alleged crimes were committed between 2013 and 2014. Chimanzi allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices, which Eskom paid. Sekgotodi said the work was "never rendered". She said the man was operating from Nelspruit. Anyone with information about Chimazi’s whereabouts is urged to contact the Hawks' warrant officer Phelani Neverdie Thwala on 071 481 3437.
