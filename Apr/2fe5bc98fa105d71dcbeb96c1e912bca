ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte has had several run-ins with reporters,   with the latest incident during an interview with an eNCA journalist on Tuesday. Video footage of Duarte lashing out at reporter Samkelo Maseko has gone viral, with many condemning her actions while the ANC has stood by her. Duarte accused Maseko of asking her "attacking" questions that were not in line with the media  briefing. "You have a habit of intimidating everybody. You have a habit of making people feel you are the lord of the media. I have never met anybody as arrogantly disposed as you are. And you want to defend freedom of speech you never fought for," she said. Speaking to an Eyewitness News (EWN) reporter in July 2018, Duarte told the reporter that radio station 702 was owned by people who "historically hated" the ANC. EWN is 702's news arm. In this case, after a media briefing at Luthuli House, the EWN reporter spoke to Duarte to clarify her comments on Tony Yengeni in the Sunday Times. After clarifying, she then instructed the reporter not to use the recording of her response because he was associated with  702. According to the radio station, Duarte said: "Some of you journalists have already made up your minds about who is and who isn't [corrupt] and you don't know anything about me." In 2009, Duarte accused BBC presenter John Humphrys of having a "mind of a colonialist" during a debate on elections when asked about the alleged political corruption regarding empty houses in Alexandra.
