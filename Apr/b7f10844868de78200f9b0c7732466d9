“Baffling” and “unclarifiable”. That is how social worker Lizette Botes described the contrast in the description that a woman gave about her ex-boyfriend, who killed her three-year-old son, who has become known as Baby Daniel. The mother previously described Naidoo as a “good father” who never hurt her or his own children. But during the trial and the pre-sentencing report on Tuesday, Botes read out her report, which painted a picture of Naidoo as an abuser who even allegedly forced Daniel to eat his own faeces.
