KwaZulu-Natal police have reported that yet another newborn baby has been found dumped in Durban. The body of the baby boy was found at the weekend. Police said the body was spotted by community members in a stream that flushes water through from a storm water drain. “[A] concealment of birth docket [has been] opened,” police said. This was at least one of two foetuses discovered last week alone. Another was found near a scrapyard in Umbilo on Friday. According to police, an employee from a scrapyard in Umbilo found the foetus of a baby boy in a plastic bag. “Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the mother is asked to contact the Umbilo police station,” said police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane.
