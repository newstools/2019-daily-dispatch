For many South Africans, the national anthem is a symbol of patriotism and a source of pride, so when professional musicians take to the stage and mangle it, it's not surprising that they get hate. Here are three times the SA anthem has been butchered. Ard Matthews During the Springbok World Cup team announcement in 2011, Matthews fumbled parts of the anthem. Matthews made several mistakes while singing the isiXhosa and Sesotho parts and then proceeded to giggle, saying he was nervous. Ras Dumisani Before a rugby test match between the Springboks and France in 2009, Ras Dumisani performed his own rendition of the anthem, which included a bit of a reggae twist and some random high notes. Kurt Darren The Afrikaans singer Kurt Darren dominated social media on Monday after messing up the Sesotho part of the national anthem during a Varsity Cup rugby game in Stellenbosch.
