Three police officers attached to the KwaZulu-Natal taxi violence unit are behind bars following their arrest in Pinetown. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the officers, aged between 44 and 51, were arrested after they demanded and received R200,000 from two alleged suspects they were investigating in connection with the provinceâ€™s troubled taxi industry. The three officers were bust after taking delivery of the cash at a mall in Pinetown on Friday. The trio will appear on Monday at the Durban Magistrate's Court on charges of corruption. In a separate case, a former public prosecutor was recently found guilty of corruption by the Kimberley Magistrate's Court. Anele Kohlani, 35, was fined R60,000 or three years' imprisonment for his dishonesty. Kohlani demanded R1,500 to R2,500 in April 2015 from a suspect - the accused in an assault case - to have charges against him withdrawn. His demands were reported to the provincial Serious Corruption Investigation team, who with the cooperation of the victim managed to arrest him minutes after he was paid R1,500, said Mulaudzi. National Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya welcomed both the arrest of the police officers and the conviction of Kohlani, saying both incidents would send a strong message to those who misuse their strategic positions for self-gain.
