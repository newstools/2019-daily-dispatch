Home affairs branches are experiencing problems after a live-capture system upgrade at the weekend, the department said on Monday. Technical teams are working on the issue. "Some offices are still unable to process Smart ID card and passport applications due to technical errors today," said the department. "All other services are available at front offices across the country, like processing and issuing of certificates for births, marriages and deaths." The department apologised for the inconvenience, adding that the system upgrade was necessary.
