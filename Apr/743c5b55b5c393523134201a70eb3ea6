Chris Hani District Municipality employees housed in offices at 42 and 22 Cathcart Road  in Komani had to be evacuated after a strong smell emerged, seemingly from the server room. Some workers from the engineering, budget and treasury offices were  sent for medical attention. One employees said they left the offices after a strong smell came from the server room. “Some of the workers were vomiting and they had to be taken for medical attention. The smell was unbearable. If the server is damaged, all our documents will be gone and they wont be recovered,” he said. When Daily Dispatch arrived,  workers were standing opposite the offices across road, as firefighters assessed the problem. Chris Hani District Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mqamela said the cause of the nauseating smell was yet to be established as chemical experts have been called in. “Some employees that were affected have been sent for medical attention, currently the area is cordoned off until it is certified safe. Further details will be communicated after a report has been made available to Chris Hani District Municipality,” he said. tembiles@dispatch.co.za
