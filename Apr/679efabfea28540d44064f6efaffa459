Raincoats, umbrellas and perhaps a pair of gumboots will be sensible items to keep handy as a cold front sweeps across the Western Cape on Thursday. Flooding is expected in some parts of the Cape metropole and Langebaan. The South African Weather Service said the cold front would make landfall over the province by mid-morning, bringing “widespread rain and showers” until late afternoon. The weather service also warned that severe thunderstorms were expected over parts of the Northern Cape, North West, Free State and Eastern Cape. It will be partly cloudy in Johannesburg, with a maximum temperature of 25. Cape Town will reach a high of 18 and Durban 29, with isolated afternoon showers.
