Naledi Pandor queued with other students, waiting in line to defend her thesis proposal and deferred to her professor even though she had previously been his boss. Now she has lived up to her portfolio as higher education minister by graduating with a doctorate from the University of Pretoria, in the latest of a string of qualifications behind her name. The official announcement is expected at 3pm but her well-wishers have already taken to social media to congratulate her over her PhD in Education, which saw her delve into transformation in higher education. Ahead of the academic celebrations, the minister is on Tuesday releasing two reports regarding the performance of the post-school education and training system in SA.
