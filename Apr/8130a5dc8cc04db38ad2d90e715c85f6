A video in which a University of Johannesburg student is seen shouting at the dean of humanities Alex Broadband at a graduation ceremony on Tuesday night, has gone viral. Eastern Cape born FeesMustFall activist Kamva Goba is accusing the dean of being racist after he was barred from graduating on his day as he arrived late. But UJ spokesman Herman Esterhuizen said the ceremony was not the appropriate avenue for Goba to express his frustration, saying: "graduation ceremonies are scheduled to start at a specific time and candidates and guests are required to take seats about 45 to 30 minutes prior to the event," added Esterhuizen.
