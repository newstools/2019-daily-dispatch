Disgraced former US soldier, Karl Kamal Rashid, who faked his death in 2011 in Sterkspruit, broke down and apologised to the United States and South African government before he was sentenced by the Mthatha high court in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. The 57 year-old was convicted on a charge of murder and three counts of fraud and was expected to be sentenced by the high court sitting in Sterkspruit. The former US marine, who initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, on Tuesday confessed to strangling to death a man. Rashid then set his car alight with the man's corpse inside and disappeared, hoping investigators would believe he had been killed in the fire. He also wrote a suicide note before disappearing. Rashid apologised to the two governments and Sterkspruit residents on Tuesday. “I made a stupid mistake and I apologise to the government of the Republic of South Africa, my home  country, the USA, and the people of  the city of Sterkspruit. I am sorry. “In all the 23 years I have been a soldier I never killed anyone, but it is now here away from my country that I made  a stupid mistake,” he said while in the dock. “I ask for forgiveness. I am sorry.” But state prosecutor Sibusiso Nolutshungu said Rashid’s pleas amounted to crocodile tears. “You are not remorseful ... Since 2011 you have been saying you are innocent, but it is only now when you are about to be sentenced that you confess to the commission of the crime that you strangled a man, set your vehicle alight and faked your death to claim insurance. “You are just acting that you are remorseful. You are not remorseful,” he said. This is a developing story
