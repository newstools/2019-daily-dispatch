The 25-year-old Mdantsane man accused of kidnapping and locking a boy of 12 inside a dog kennel overnight will spend the next three weeks in jail, waiting for bail. Earlier Mdantsane magistrate Thethiswa Ketelo postponed Lerato Makoa’s bail application to April 25, when he briefly appeared in court on Tuesday. He is facing three charges, including kidnapping, child abuse and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Makoa appeared calm and in good spirits in court. He was arrested on Friday after the boy was rescued by the Mdantsane police. He had been locked in a cage used by the suspect’s pitbulls. The charge sheet details how Makoa “unlawfully” and “intentionally” deprived the victim’s freedom of movement by means of allegedly kidnapping him and locking him inside the boot of a vehicle. The state charges that Makoa then kept the victim overnight in a dog kennel and chained him. State prosecutor Shirley Jaftha opposed bail, citing that Makoa was a flight risk and was difficult to trace. The case was opened by the Child Protection, Family Violence and Sexual Assaults Unit. This was after the boy’s grandmother declined to open a case. She said that Makoa had been trying to help as the young victim was a “troublemaker” who sometimes left home to live on the streets. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
