A suspected rapist escaped from the Mdantsane magistrate’s court on Tuesday. Acting court manager Anneline Swart confirmed  the man slipped out of A court, where he was due to appear before magistrate Fezeka Monakali, to face the rape charge. Swart, who referred further questions to the justice department head offices in Pretoria, confirmed that the accused escaped shortly before the tea break around 11am. “From the information we have so far, it appears that he disappeared while the court orderly had left the court room to call another accused at the waiting area. “We are still viewing CCTV footage to confirm everything.” Swart said the escapee was last seen sitting with a group of other accused on the waiting dock. “It is suspected that he got up, walked down the stairs of the  courtroom and used the underground passage to another court room and escaped there.” Police spokesperson Captain Mluleki Mbi said they were investigating the matter.
