In an unprecedented move, attorneys and advocates in Mthatha took the morning off from court on Monday to march through the CBD in protest, demanding more cases from government. Clad in black and white with court gowns in hand, they went to hand in a memorandum of demands to the office of the state attorney. They complained about their work allegedly being taken away and given to a white Johannesburg-based firm. Speaking on behalf of the attorney and advocates, Sinawo Makangela, said they had informed all stakeholders of their march. As a result, court proceedings had been halted for the morning. “We are determined to be heard. Our demands are clear, this is a revolution,” Makangela said. One advocate said she had been working but had not yet been paid all year, adding that she had been unable to pay rent at her chambers all year.
