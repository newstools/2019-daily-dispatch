Just under two years into his five-year contract, Eastern Cape education department CFO Jason O’Hara has been suspended. O’Hara, who joined the department in March 2018, was placed on precautionary suspension amid allegations of administrative misconduct   by the department's superintendent-general, Themba Kojana, on Wednesday. His suspension was confirmed by department spokesperson Loyiso Pulumani. The CFO would be the subject of a probe by a team of external investigators, he said. “The department has, after due processes, and in the interest of good management and best practices, decided to place Jason O’Hara, on precautionary suspension. This is based on allegations of administrative misconduct that are considered serious enough to justify further in-depth investigations,” said Pulumani. The suspension was “by no means a presumption or an accusation of guilt”, but a precautionary measure to preserve the integrity of the investigation and to dispel any accusation of undue interference. Attempts to reach O’Hara for comment on Wednesday were unsuccessful as his phone went straight to voicemail. Recently, members of the Bhisho legislature's portfolio committee on education raised concerns over O'Hara's prolonged absence in committee meetings, including meetings where the department's annual report and financial statements were discussed.
