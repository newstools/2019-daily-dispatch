Santa is bringing a mixed bag of weather on Christmas Day. SA Weather Service Port Elizabeth spokesperson Garth Sampson predicted that Christmas Day would be  warm, cloudy and rainy. He warned beachgoers to be careful  as unfavourable sea conditions were  expected. “With the spring high tide, wave heights will be enhanced and there will also be rip currents. Please be careful when visiting the beach.” Christmas Day will be fine to partly cloudy and warm over most of the Eastern Cape. “Showers and thunder showers are expected along the coastal belt and adjacent interior as well as the northern and eastern parts of the province later. It will be windy over the interior.” Sampson said Boxing Day would start off with showery conditions south of the escarpment. “It will clear from the west later and become fine. Windy conditions are expected later in the day.”
