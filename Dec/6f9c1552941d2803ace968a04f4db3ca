Australian bushfires have caused unprecedented pollution in Sydney and along the country’s east coast, with smoke and dust burning residents’ eyes and prompting a spike in respiratory complaints. Hundreds of bushfires have burnt out of control since September up and down the eastern seaboard, blanketing cities from Sydney to Brisbane in smoke for weeks on end. The extent of the crisis was made clear on Thursday, with the New South Wales department of environment declaring bushfires and dust had caused some of the highest air pollution ever seen in Australia.
