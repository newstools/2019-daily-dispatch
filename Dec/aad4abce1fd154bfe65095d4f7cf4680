A slowdown in electricity usage due to the start of the holidays is helping Eskom to keep the lights on, the utility said in a statement on Thursday. Announcing there will be no load-shedding, Eskom said the return of some generating units to service was also helping it to maintain its service. This despite a fire at the Majuba power plant in Mpumalanga on Wednesday, which caused damage that energy expert Chris Yelland said would take up to two months to repair.
