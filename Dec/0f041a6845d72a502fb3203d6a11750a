A former friend of Fritz Jourbert says the killer was considering fleeing SA and settling in Zimbabwe to escape his financial and legal troubles. At the centre of these plans, the Dispatch has established, was a Zimbabwean lawyer who Joubert had befriended and who he allowed to stay at his Gonubie farm. After a tip-off from a reader, the close friend confirmed he knew of the lawyer. “I know that poor Zimbabwean guy. “He made him do work and facilitate the deal to bring big cats to the farm. “Fritz was toxic, he would chase the guy and kick him off the farm but when he needed him, he would invite him back.”  Joubert owned people millions of rands after his business collapsed. Earlier this week, DispatchLIVE reported that Joubert was out on a warning on a robbery charge. This involved an altercation he had with a customer at a restaurant in Bloemfontein in April. He was due to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court again on January 21. The friend said Joubert and the lawyer often travelled to Zimbabwe to try to find investors for his predator breeding project. “He was planning to flee to Zimbabwe as a back-up plan should things not work out because he owed a lot of people millions in this country and was in trouble with the law,” the friend said malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
