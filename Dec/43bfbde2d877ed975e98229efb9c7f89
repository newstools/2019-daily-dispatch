With thousands of bathers expected to flock to the notorious but  popular Second Beach, Port St Johns authorities have announced that motorists will not be allowed to park at the beach over the height of the festive season. Boom gates will also be set up at various points about the town, with mayor Nomvuzo Mlombile-Cingo warning that those who park illegally at the beach will have their cars towed away. “Should a vehicle be found parked illegally it will be towed away. It will be released upon payment of R1,500, which is non-negotiable,” she said. The mayor said the decision to ban cars from  Second Beach was to  create more space for emergency access. “Sometimes temperatures go up so much that people fall down and faint. Also we cannot be so naive to say that there cannot be drownings this time. We are taking a proactive stance in that regard as part of our risk management strategy.” She said though drownings had reduced  considerably this year, they  did not want to take any chances. Instead, motorists will be allowed to park at Mangrove, about 1km away. Mlombile-Cingo said Mangrove could accommodate 500 cars, but each car would be charged R200 for parking. Alternatively, the PSJ sports field would be made available for parking at no fee. Motorists would then have to take taxis to the beach. Eight bathers have been killed by sharks over the last 15 years and 13 people have drowned at the beach in the last five years. The bathers would come in their thousands over the New Year, said Mlombile-Cingo. She said no drownings had been reported on Christmas Day, which she felt was because many people spent the day at home with their families. She  said 40 lifeguards had been recruited and were working in shifts. Bathers should  swim in designated areas,  indicated by yellow and red flags set in the sand by lifeguards.
