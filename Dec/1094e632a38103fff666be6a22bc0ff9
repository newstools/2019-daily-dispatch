Granny Milicent Nozipho Dlulane, who turned 100 on Tuesday, says there is nothing magical about reaching her age; it's simply a blessing from God. Born in 1919, the centenarian from Mpeko village was treated like royalty when her family hosted a lavish birthday party to mark her milestone on December 24. One of those who  joined the celebrations was Eastern Cape department of sport, reaction, arts & culture MEC Fezeka Bayeni. “It's not magic,” Dlulane told the Dispatch this week.  The former schoolteacher said she did not  have a special diet and ate everything she was served. “I eat anything but I love chicken a lot. I am also known for my love of fruit especially bananas. My other favourite thing to eat is yoghurt.” Dlulane  bore eight children and six are still alive. Though her memory sometimes fails her, her eyesight is still as sharp as ever. She said she also loved taking walks to the shops in the village and around her house, just to keep fit. She also used to work in her  garden but  stopped in recent years as her energy levels were  getting depleted. Bayeni  congratulated Dlulane on her milestone. “You are not going anywhere. We will come back when you are 110. The premier will come in person with a present for you,” she added. Dlulane's grandson, Samkelo Dlulane, 40, said they were blessed to have their grandmother and to witness her turning 100. “She is the glue that holds the family together. Her great-grandchildren love her to bits,” he said.
