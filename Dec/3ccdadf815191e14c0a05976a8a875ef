Tsolo-born Zozibini Tunzi is the new Miss Universe. She walked away with the crown in Atlanta in the US in the early hours of Monday morning, SA time. Tunzi won Miss SA earlier this year. She becomes only the third South African to win the title after Margaret Gardiner  (1978), and Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters (2017). Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane was one of the first to congratulate her. “I want to join millions of South Africans, friends in other countries in congratulating Zozibini Tunzi for winning the Miss Universe 2019 crown,” he said in a statement issued after 6am. “Zozibini Tunzi’s success at the Miss Universe 2019 competition is a victory that should inspire young girls from all rural villages that they too can be the best in what they do when they focus on it and work to achieve their goals.” He said her victory proved that when South Africans worked together, supported each other, “we make it possible for our young people to stand tall in such important competitions”.
