Suspended senior policewoman Lt-Gen Adeline Shezi appeared in the Pretoria specialised commercial crimes court on Tuesday on charges of fraud and corruption. Two family members appeared alongside her. The charges relate to the period when Shezi was head of the police’s technology management services (TMS) in  2015 and 2016. It was revealed in April last year that Shezi was under investigation by police watchdog the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for alleged corruption. “These alleged criminal offences are believed to have taken place between herself and Unisys company,” said Ipid spokesperson Sontaga Seisa. “It is alleged that Unisys had some dodgy business relationship between itself and General Shezi on building her house to the estimated amount of over R2.1m." Seisa said Ipid investigated the case in collaboration with the investigative directorate within the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to ensure a successful prosecution. “Warrants of arrest were issued against the 49-year-old general and two family members, aged 39 and 63, who appeared today here in Pretoria on the charges of fraud and corruption.” All three were released on bail of R1,000 each and will appear in court again on February 7 next year. Shezi was suspended in November last year following an ongoing forensic investigation that implicated her in dubious financial transactions amounting to millions of rand. Ipid said Shezi's arrest was to ensure that "police officers who are accused of wrongdoing and irrespective of rank and seniority are held accountable".
