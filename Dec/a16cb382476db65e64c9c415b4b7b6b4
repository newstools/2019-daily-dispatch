An abandoned week-old baby weighing 3.2 kg was found by the police under the Fleet Street bridge on Saturday morning. The baby boy, now receiving food and treatment at Frere Hospital, was found wrapped in blankets by East London Railway police officers. Railway Police spokesperson Constable Khanyisa Nkanjeni said the police were notified by a member of the public about what looked like an abandoned baby. Nkanjeni said the police responded and made the discovery at around 6.30am. Nkanjeni said a case of child abandonment was registered. She said the police are looking for the mother of the child for questioning. Eastern Cape department of health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the baby was recovering well and was in a good condition. “ He appears fine. We are running all medical tests on him. He weights 3.2kg. The umbilical cord dried so appears to be about a week old.” Kupelo said once the the baby has been found healthy, he will be handed over to social workers for adoption.
