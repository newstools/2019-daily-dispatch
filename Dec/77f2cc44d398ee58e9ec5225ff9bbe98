The SA U19 team meekly surrendered the ODI series to the India U19s with an eight-wicket loss in the second of three matches at Buffalo Park on Saturday afternoon. After going down by nine wickets in the opening match on Thursday, South Africa were looking for a much improved response but instead produced an even worse effort, as India chased down their poor 119 all out in just over 16 overs. India won the toss and sent SA in to bat. Despite the early loss of Levert Manje (7) the SA U19s would have been relatively happy with their start at 37/1 in the eighth over. However Andrew Louw (24) who looked good in striking five boundaries, then became Akash Singh's second wicket. Jonathan Bird and Luke Beaufort then looked to rebuild the innings with the highest partnership of 34, taking their side to 71/2 in the 16th over before the wheels came off. Beaufort (12) was bowled by Ravi Bishnoi, while new man Tyrese Karelse for a duck and Bird (25) fell to Atharva Ankolekar in the next over and SA suddenly found themselves on 73/5. Only two other batsmen reached double figures, captain Khanya Cotani (13) and Tiaan van Vuuren who showed good fight in registering an unbeaten 18, but the 119 all out was never expected to trouble the Indian youngsters. All-rounder Yashasvi Jaiswal claimed all of the last four SA wickets on his way to figures of 4/13 and emphatically took that momentum into the batting effort. Early wickets to Merrick Brett and Mondli Khumalo may have given the SA U19s a bit of hope in the Indian innings with the Inidia U19s on 26/2, but Jaiswal then took centre stage and absolutely blitzed his side to the win. They picked up the run-rate from being 37/2 after eight overs, to reach 120/2 after 16.2. Jaiswal finished unbeaten on 89 off 56 balls having struck 14 boundaries and three maximums, to cap off a brilliant all-round match winning performance. The SA U19s now have one final chance to pick up a desperately needed win in the final game of the series at Buffalo Park on Monday morning, starting at 10am. After the ODI series the team heads into a quadrangular series, followed by the 2020 ICC U19 Cricket World Cup, which SA will be hosting.
