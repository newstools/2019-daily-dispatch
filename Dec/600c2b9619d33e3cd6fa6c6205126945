“Nobody deserves to die the way that my brother did.” These were the words of a visibly shaken Olwethu Hoyana, the brother of the late Anele Hoyana, who was brutally killed last week by farmer Fritz Joubert. An emotional Olwethu told hundreds of mourners who gathered at the Hoyana family homestead in Kwelerha, that his younger brother was a loving and protective family man. “The videos that have circulated on social show an Anele who was trapped, an Anele that we didn’t recognize. “After his wife and children’s lives were put in danger, the Anele we know would have fought tooth and nail but couldn’t.” Olwethu recalled the horrific moment when he identified the body of his late sangoma brother. “I noticed multiple slash wounds in his face. When I counted there were about 10 of those deep wounds. What kind of a person would bludgeon another human being who was visibly beat down?” Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane told mourners that Anele’s life should be celebrated as he was an “ambitious and progressive man”. “As we have heard here today, Anele was a very diligent man who had dreams and aspirations. Let us celebrate his life and keep his legacy alive. “I want to say to the Hoyana family, we are deeply sorry for the pain that has come into your family. May God’s peace which surpasses all understanding be with you always,” said Mabuyane. Nkosi Phatekile Holomisa joined the hundreds of mourners who laid Anele to rest.
