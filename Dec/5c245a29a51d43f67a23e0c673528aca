Four men accused of killing a police constable in Coffee Bay have been nabbed. The suspects, aged between 22 and 37 were arrested on Friday morning, provincial hawks spokesperson Captain Anelisa Ngcakani said. Constable Lonwabo Soga, 26, was killed in Coffee Bay on December 3. “The 37-year-old was arrested in Mqanduli while the rest of the suspects were arrested in Mthatha,” Ngcakani said. They are expected to appear in the Mthatha magistrate’s court on Monday. They were arrested through an intelligence driven operation conducted by the Hawks' serious organised crime investigation unit, crime intelligence and the national intervention unit, said Ngcakani. “The team recovered six unlicensed firearms including the one belonging to the deceased officer which was robbed during the incident as well as ammunition. “An assortment of police equipment including hand cuffs, reflector jacket and a hand radio were found during the suspects arrests,” she said.
