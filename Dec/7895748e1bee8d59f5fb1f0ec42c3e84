Former anti-apartheid activist and economics professor Ben Turok died on Monday morning, aged 92. In a short statement, Turok's family announced that he passed away in the early hours of the morning, December 9. "He was always outspoken and dedicated his whole life to fighting for freedom, equality and social justice in South Africa. He was a loyal, lifetime member of the ANC, but retained an independent perspective throughout. "He asked for his death to be marked by a private ceremony, rather than anything official or formal, in view of the present predicament facing the country. His wisdom and counsel will be sorely missed," said the family in a statement. Turok , also former ANC MP, recently served as director of the Institute for African Alternatives and editor of the journal New Agenda. In the last few months, he spoke out against corporate greed, irresponsible misspending in the public sector and Â the unemployed, poor and seriously disadvantaged in our society to continue to accept such an unfair and unequal system?"
