The Serious Commercial Crime Investigation wing of the Hawks in the Eastern Cape is looking for this unidentified man  who the unit believes has  valuable information which may help solve a case involving fraud of R10m. Hawks provincial spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani said they were looking for this unknown man  in connection with an investment company known as Stock I Training which allegedly duped more than 70 people who invested  just over R10m. She said Stock I Training  operated from King William’s Town and East London from 2015 to 2017. “It is alleged that about 70 investors invested  roughly R10m. It is further alleged that the investors never received the return from their investments which was promised to them as the agents of Stock I Training allegedly disappeared,” Ngcakani said. She said the  man was not a suspect, but a person of interest. Any person with information  is urged to contact the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Nico Koen, on 072-579-4992 or 041-408-2603.
