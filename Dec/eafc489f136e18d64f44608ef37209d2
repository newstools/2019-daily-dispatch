Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has been admitted to hospital in Cape Town. Speaking through the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation on Wednesday, his wife Leah said: “Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has been admitted to hospital to receive treatment for a stubborn infection. The Archbishop has been hospitalised several times over the past few years for treatment of a similar condition.” Tutu, who is 88,  retired from public life several years ago. He was  in good spirits recently, wishing the Boks  luck before the Rugby World Cup in Japan. He was  visited by Springbok captain Siya Kolisi when the team returned home with the Webb Ellis trophy. The Nobel Laureate met with Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, along with their baby son Archie in Cape Town in September.
