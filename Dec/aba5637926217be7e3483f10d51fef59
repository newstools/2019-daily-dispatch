After Eskom announced unprecedented stage 6 load-shedding on Monday, BusinessLIVE reporter Mudiwa Gavaza provides insight into the causes of the latest blackouts - as well as what stage 8 load-shedding could mean for South Africans. The ailing power utility said the move to stage 6, which had never been implemented before, was due to a shortage of capacity. "This follows a technical problem at Medupi power station impacting additional generation supply," it said on Twitter. Rainfall was also blamed. "The heavy rains have caused coal-handling and operational problems at several power stations," added Eskom.
