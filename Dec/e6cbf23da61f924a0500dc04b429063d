Scores of beachgoers were evacuated after  a great white shark was spotted by lifeguards at Eastern Beach in East London  on Monday. Buffalo City Metro spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya said the popular beach was closed at midday and reopened at 2pm. “ We evacuated more than a thousand bathers and commissioned a helicopter and searched the sea but we could not find the shark.” In a message on the BCM Facebook page, Ngwenya said: “Following the closure of the Eastern Beach at about two hours ago, the Municipality has reopened it to the public. A shark was spotted earlier which led to the temporary closure of the beach as a precautionary measure. City safety officials patrol the area on air and have since declared the area relatively safe for swimming. Beachgoers are urged to swim within the flags set up by lifeguards and obey instructions at all times.” Monday's incident comes five days after Nahoon Beach was closed to the public on Thursday after Hudson Primary school teacher Roger Swinney,58, escaped from the jaws of a great white shark. Swinney was rescued by his 16-year-old son Luke after being tossed off his ski. The shark had taken a big bite of his ski, tossing him off.
