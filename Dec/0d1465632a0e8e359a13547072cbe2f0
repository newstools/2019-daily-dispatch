A court bid to set aside art and culture minister Nathi Mthethwaâ€™s decision to change the name of Grahamstown to Makhanda has failed. Makhanda will remain the official name of the small city. Grahamstown high court Judge Murray Lowe yesterday found Mthethwa and the provincial and national geographic name change councils had acted in strict accordance with all consultative and other requirements before recommending and deciding on the name change. The Grahamstown High Court will continue to be referred to as such until the superior courts Act is amended to change the name of the division.
