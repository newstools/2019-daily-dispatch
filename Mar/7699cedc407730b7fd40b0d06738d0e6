Medical doctor Chwayita Yako will have to wait until June to have his day in court. Yako, who is accused of fraud, appeared briefly on Monday in the Mthatha regional court. His trial starts on June 24. Yako was released on R15,000 bail late in 2018 after he was arrested by the Hawksâ€™ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit for fraud relating to a R75m loan he allegedly took to build Mthatha Private Hospital on Nelson Mandela Drive. It was alleged Yako made withdrawals amounting to R2.3m for his personal use without authorisation from the other shareholders. The Dispatch earlier reported that Yako had been interdicted by the high court from entering the new hospital after he allegedly diverted millions of rands from the project into his private company. He failed to service a loan from the IDC and the hospital has been placed under business rescue. At the time, the court heard that the 52-bed hospital struggled to attract enough patients because it had bought poor equipment and had been unable to treat patients adequately, and that support from other doctors was not forthcoming.
