Police have made a breakthrough in the murder case of East London business woman Busisiwe Ngwadla after a suspect in his 50’s was arrested in Cape Town on Sunday morning. The 37-year-old victim was found lying in a pool of blood in front of her bathroom door at the Emerald Sky flats in Amalinda last month. Her family believes she was killed by her boyfriend Ayanda “Mpiriri” Matika after a heated argument. Provincial head corporate communication and liaison Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said the suspect whose identity cannot be revealed was arrested in Khayelitsha. “The suspect disappeared from the Eastern Cape immediately after the murder of  Busisiwe whose body was found in February, with multiple stab wounds in her flat at Amalinda. "Subsequently, the incident which angered the members of the community including the affected families exerted a lot of pressure on the investigation processes as people wanted a speedy arrest of the alleged perpetrator,” he said. The suspect is due at the East London magistrate court soon. This is a developing story.
