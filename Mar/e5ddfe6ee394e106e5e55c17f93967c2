A 36-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly raped and strangled a woman to death in Bultfontein, Free State, police said on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Captain Stephen Thakeng said the body of the 25-year-old woman was found in a hole, near the informal settlement Motsemohlophe where children were playing. Her body was found last week. Thakeng said on their arrival, they found the woman on her back with her jeans and underwear below her knees. "No visible injuries were seen on the victim, and she was allegedly strangled to death by the suspect," he said. "It is alleged that that the suspect first attempted to rape and strangle the victimâ€™s friend and he ran away when the victim called him by his name and that is when he went to the deceased and proceeded with his evil deeds." The suspect Mohlolo Jonase appeared in the Bultfontein Magistrate's Court on March 18 and the case was postponed until March 25 for the bail application.
