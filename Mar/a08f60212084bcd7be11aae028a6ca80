Load-shedding has resumed across the country. In a statement on Thursday morning, Eskom said due to a shortage of capacity Stage 1 load-shedding would be implemented from 11am. It is likely to continue until 11pm. “Stage 1 calls for 1,000MW to be rotantionally load-shed nationally at a given period.  We appeal to residents to use electricity sparingly during this period,” the statement said.
