Video footage of the King Air plane‚ operated by a local charter company‚ flying low over the ground and then‚ in a second clip setting fire to several vehicles after it crashed into the Matsieng Aerodrome near Rasesa‚ north of Gaborone‚ circulated on social media on Sunday. Authorities in Botswana could not be reached on Sunday to clarify if any other people were killed or injured. Botswana Civil Aviation Authority flight operations inspector Phemelo Chominyana confirmed that the incident had happened on Saturday but said by phone that he had no further details. Initial‚ unconfirmed reports suggested that the pilot worked for a charter company in Botswana and had been involved in an altercation with a woman at the clubhouse. After being told to leave the venue‚ he allegedly flew the aircraft towards the clubhouse‚ while phoning somebody at the function on the ground. People were told to evacuate just before the aircraft hit the building. TimesLIVE reached out to the charter company for comment but a person who answered the phone there on Sunday declined to comment. TimesLIVE is aware of the name of the pilot but there has been no official confirmation of his identity by police in Botswana. - TimesLIVE
