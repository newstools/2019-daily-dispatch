Songbird Kelly Khumalo should be a preacher with all the pearls of wisdom she's been dropping lately. Kelly has BEEN sharing motivational messages with her fans and this week preached to her instagram followers about knowing their worth. She told her followers that it was not up to them to try convince people of their worth, its either people see it, or they don't. Kelly advised her followers not to negotiate their worth. You teach people how to treat you. “By trying to negotiate your worth, you are only exposing yourself to disrespect because negotiating can turn into disrespect when people are offering you nothing but sh*t.” Amen to that!
