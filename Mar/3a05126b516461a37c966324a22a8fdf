A number of people were injured on Tuesday during a shootout between two taxi associations in Soweto. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the incident happened at the early hours of Tuesday morning between Dube and Mofolo streets. "The shooting was between two taxi associations. It is alleged that they were fighting over a route, but we are investigating the motive," Makhubele said. He said the police were deployed in the area and were monitoring the situation. "There are people injured but we do not know how many they are. There were cars that were also damaged." Meanwhile, several minibus taxis blockaded Elias Motsoaledi and Koma roads in Soweto on Tuesday. "Taxis were blocking the intersection and they said they were unhappy about the Rea Vaya service, what it is they are unhappy about, we don't know," said metro police department spokesperson Wayne Minaar.
