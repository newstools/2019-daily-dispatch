Thousands of fish are dying in East London’s Nahoon River, posing a massive threat to the ecology of the area. On Saturday, Nahoon resident Que Hundermark captured video footage of thousands of dead, floating fish including barbel, eel, bass and carp. “It’s unbelievable. The area also has a lot of wildlife like fish eagles and leguaans, so with the fish dying it could affect the whole eco-system of the Nahoon,” Hundermark said. Kevin Cole, of the East London Museum, suggested a combination of water hyacinth weed and pollutants in the water could be responsible for the death of the fish. “The situation would need to be investigated further,” he said. johnh@dispatch.co.za
