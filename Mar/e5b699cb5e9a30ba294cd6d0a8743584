Endumisweni Faith Mission Church leader Tshidi Spampool made a brief appearance at the Mdantsane magistrate’s court on Thursday morning for seven charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Spampool was surrounded by a group of male and female supporters, who all clung to her side. When she was called in front of magistrate Paul Pretorius, a seemingly blind Spampool had to be escorted to the dock by one of her supporters. She said she would be opting for legal aid representation. Pretorius postponed the case to 24 April, saying more evidence was being gathered. After her appearance Spampool and her entourage jubilantly walked out of court. The group shielded the church leader from reporters as they whisked her away. She is accused of assaulting former congregants at the church’s NU8 premises. She has said when she assaulted former congregants in a video that went viral she was applying the church’s constitution.
