Eastern Cape police are searching for a missing East London teenager who disappeared from her home in November. Cambridge police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi on Tuesday said the 16-year-old girl, Athule Jadezweni, was last seen at her Vincent, East London, home on the night of November 17. Mbi said the Hudson Park High School pupil was only reported missing to police on March 10. “We are not sure why the family waited this long before reporting her missing,” said Mbi. He said the teenager had been in Grade 10 last year. Mbi said police had done their primary investigation, which had yielded no positive results. “Police are now seeking the public’s help in locating this 16-year-old girl, and anyone who might have information on her whereabouts, should kindly contact the Cambridge police station detectives on 043-709-7500 or Crime Stop at 086-0010-111,” said Mbi. Attempts to get comment from the teenager’s family were unsuccessful at the time of writing. asandan@dispatch.co.za
