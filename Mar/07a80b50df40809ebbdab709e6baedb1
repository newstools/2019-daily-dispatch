In an emotional end to his testimony at the state capture inquiry, former Eskom fuel sourcing manager Johann Bester said he could not confide in, nor trust, his superiors. Breaking into tears, Bester told deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo on Tuesday that it was a "tragedy" that Eskom officials were suspended or forced out because they would not comply with unscrupulous decisions by their managers. "Even though I had been at Eskom probably not as long as some of the colleagues I referred to ... these are people that I could look up to, that I could trust. When they had been removed or left, I definitely didn't have someone in [Vusi] Mboweni that I could confide in. He wouldn't give me guidance. "I knew I couldn't trust [Matshela] Koko. It was clear that [Ayanda Ntetha] was being influenced and put pressure on from the executive going over me. It was clear that they wanted to replace me," Bester said.
