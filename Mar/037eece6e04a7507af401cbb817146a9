A foetus was found wrapped in a bag and dumped in a rubbish bin in Dawncliff in Westville, Durban, on Thursday. "It is unclear how long the foetus had been in the rubbish bin," said Netcare911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst on Friday. A member of the public found the infant and  alerted a security guard from a nearby shopping centre. Paramedics were called to the scene just after 6pm. Police are investigating.
