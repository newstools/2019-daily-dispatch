Bosasa employee Peet Venter appeared before the Zondo Commission on Tuesday. In his testimony, Venter detailed some of the corrupt activities Bosasa allegedly committed at the instruction of CEO Gavin Watson. Venter, a tax consultant, was previously a SARS employee when he met Bosasa executive Andries Van Tonder.Here are some of the figures that Venter implicated in his testimony: Andile Ramaphosa Venter said he was instructed by Bosasa head Gavin Watson to make a payment of R500,000 to President Cyril Ramaphosa's son Andile. Venter added that he did not know much about the payment and that no service was rendered to the company. Venter alleged that the money was paid to his company Miotto Trading and Advisory Holdings, then transferred to Andile. In an exclusive interview with News24 on Monday, Andile admitted that he was paid R2m by Bosasa in a deal he now "regrets". Hlaudi Motsoeneng Venter alleged that he was instructed by Watson to pay for former SABC head Hlaudi Motsoeneng's legal fees to fight his dismissal from the public broadcaster.He said about R1m was allegedly paid to Majavu Inc, owned by Motsoeneng's lawyer Zola Majavu. Linda Mti and Patrick Gillingham Venter alleged that at some point he was instructed by Watson to do annual tax returns for Bosasa directors and two state officials. Former correctional services commissioner Linda Mti and former correctional services CFO Patrick Gillingham allegedly had their annual tax returns done by Venter. Venter said the service fee for both the taxes of the directors and the correctional services officials were paid through one invoice.
