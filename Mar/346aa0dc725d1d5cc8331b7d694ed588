The office of ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu has shed more light on the death of his daughter, Khwezi. His spokesperson, Nonceba Mhlauli, said Mthembu was on his way home from parliament on Tuesday night when he received a call from another daughter informing him of a tragedy that had occurred at their home. "Upon arrival at his parliamentary village home in Pelican Park, Cape Town, he was confronted by a very painful sight of his daughter, Khwezi Mthembu, who had, by all indications, taken her own life in her room," Mhlauli said in a statement. "This is a very traumatic and painful experience for the family and we ask South Africans to keep us in their prayers during this difficult time. "We thank those who are sending messages of condolences to the chief whip and the Mthembu family. "The office will release details of the funeral in due course." Mthembu had earlier taken to Twitter to communicate the passing of his 25-year old daughter. He was due to hold a press conference to provide his assessment of the ANC parliamentary caucus for the past five years as the national legislature goes into recess ahead of this year's elections. This has  since been postponed. The ANC in the Western Cape said it had learnt with regret and deep sadness of the tragedy. "Our thoughts and sympathies are with the Mthembu family, and as we extend our heartfelt condolences to them, we ask that they are given space to mourn their loss," it said in a statement.
