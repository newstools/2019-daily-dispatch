The ANC’s provincial executive committee has suspended its Buffalo City Metro ward 20 councillor Ntombizodwa Gamnca following corruption allegations laid against her by Mdantsane residents to the party last week. Gamnca will be immediately replaced by ANC PR councillor Ncedo Kumbaca as acting ward councillor while the party investigates the allegations of illegal sales of houses in the ward. Gamnca  was recently found guilty of robbery and intimidation and slapped with a R10,000 fine at the East London magistrate’s court. She has also been accused of selling houses to residents and failing to deliver their title deeds. Her temporary removal was received with cheers and applause on Monday when ANC PEC member Loyiso Magqashela addressed hundreds of ANC members and supporters and residents in NU7.
