Residents of Ezibeleni braved the cold weather on Tuesday and protested outside the Komani magistrates court calling for the magistrate Xolisa Ngwendu not to grant bail to the 34-year-old man accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in February. ANC Womens League,  Ezibeleni church leaders and teachers, Treatment Action Campaign and department of public works community works programme (CWP) came in numbers to show their support for the victim and call for the suspect to rot in jail. Reading the memorandum, ANCWL gender based violence coordinator Bulelwa Mgijima called the suspect a monster who prays on young girls to satisfy his dirty mind. “He has killed the future of this young girl. The girl is still traumatized by this incident and we are calling on the magistrate to deny the suspect bail,” she said. Testifying during the bail application, constable Bhadikazi Ngotini on February 14 the suspect a taxi driver took the victim to the bushes just outside Komani where he allegedly raped him. “This started by the suspect closing the road for the victim every time he saw her going to town demanding her cell phone number. Finally the victim gave him her number and there are WhatsApp messages between the two of them,” she said. Ngotini said on the day of the incident,  the suspect called the victim asking her where she was and she told him. “He took him to a bush where he raped her in the taxi and dropped her in town after that.
