Eskom says the chances of stage 8 load-shedding is “low” but it has published an updated load-shedding timetable on its website. “The likelihood of reaching stage 8 is low,” Eskom said. On Tuesday, it was reported that the government was preparing for stages 5 and 6 load-shedding. In terms of these schedules, residents could be without power up to six times, or 12 hours, a day. “The Disaster Management Act requires Eskom to develop contingency plans for identified major incidents. A severe supply constraint is one of these, for which Eskom has plans in place. Eskom also continually improves these plans,” the parastatal said. Stage 8 load-shedding could leave customers without power for more than 12 hours a day in Johannesburg and Pretoria. Eskom said most metros had developed schedules for up to stage 8. Eskom first published a schedule for load-shedding for stages 1 to 8 in November last year. “The national code was subsequently updated. This has been published and caters for eight stages of load-shedding. This is currently with Nersa (the national energy regulator) for approval.” Eskom said it would update customers about the schedule on its website. – TimesLIVE
