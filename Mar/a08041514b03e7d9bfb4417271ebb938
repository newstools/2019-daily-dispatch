Police have confirmed that a viral video showing a police woman being ‘assaulted’ by a police man was a re-enactment of a real life domestic violence situation. In the video a woman is seen to be physically assaulted while a group of policemen watch the scene. She then proceeds to wail and leave the room. SAPS provincial spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the police have launched an investigation to find out who is responsible for filming and posting the video on social media. “It is suspected that a police official, who might have attended this training intervention at our Durban Training Center last year, could be responsible for recording this scene and posting the clip on-line. We are indeed perturbed and believe that this individual was extremely malicious because of the timing of the release of the video,” he said.
