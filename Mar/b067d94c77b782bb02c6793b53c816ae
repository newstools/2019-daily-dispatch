Traffic flow at the East London CBD has been interrupted as thousands of Walter Sisulu University students are marching up Oxford Street. Police and Law enforcement personnel are monitoring the situation. Students at the Buffalo City campus have been on protest over distribution of NSFAS allowances since Thursday. Last night the protest turned violent as students blockaded some streets in Southernwood and Quigney with burning objects. At least nine students were arrested for public violence.
