Reigning African Boxing Union champion Ayanda Ndulani, of Scenery Park made a brief appearance in front of magistrate Rochelle Sam at the packed East London magistrate court on Wednesday morning. He is accused of rape, and is out on bail. His arrest and first appearance was in December. On Wednesday, a clean-shaven Ndulani rocked his famous mo-hawk haircut and a striking red T-shirt. Sam asked Ndulani if he was abandoning state legal representation for his own lawyer. "I hear you have decided to appoint your own attorney", she asked, to which Ndulani nodded. Ndulaniâ€™s case was postponed to April 24 for further investigation.
