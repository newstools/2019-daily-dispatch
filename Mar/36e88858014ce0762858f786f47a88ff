What initially seemed like a rescue attempt by a hippo ended up in death for a young kudu. Latest Sightings says the kudu was chased into the water by a pack of wild dogs. The hippo latches on to the antelope - but instead of shepherding it towards land, it drowns the animal. "My eight-year-old granddaughter, who was watching the events unfold, innocently thought that the hippo was a hero for trying to rescue a baby kudu," said Carolyn Wridgway, an estate agent who filmed the incident in the Kruger National Park. "She was very sad when the kudu drowned and the hippo's tooth went right through it." Once the hippo moves the kudu to the edge of the water, it starts having a tug-of-war with the wild dogs, before trying to chase them away from the dead animal. According to Wridgway, once the hippo moved away, the wild dogs dragged the kudu behind a bush and started eating it. The dogs later left the carcass for vultures to feast on. "We have never witnessed a kill taking place, so this was exceptionally rare for us and even more so given the nature of the kill," said Wridgway.
