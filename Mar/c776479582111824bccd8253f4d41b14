Hlaudi Motsoeneng,   former SABC chief operating officer and president of newly formed political party the African Content Movement (ACM), dominated conversation on social media on Thursday after an interview on Power FM about his relationship with Bosasa, and his party. "South Africa is rejoicing because they know that Hlaudi is ascending towards the presidency soon," he said during one of the many hilarious moments from the interview. However, this  was not the first time Motsoeneng sat at the  top of the Twitter trends list. Tweeps dug  deep  for other amusing Motsoeneng moments. 'Shady' ACM manifesto Motsoeneng is pulling out all the stops to get South Africans to vote his party into power come the May 8 elections. A video of him attempting to convince  voters that the ACM  is "the one" went viral, not because of his speech, but because it was filmed  under a tree. 'No one will capture Hlaudi, I capture myself' Speaking to Power FM on Thursday, Hlaudi denied being captured by Bosasa, saying he captures himself. 'People around the world are after Hlaudi' In 2016, while his fitness to hold office at the SABC was being investigated, Hlaudi addressed the media on his standing with the public broadcaster. 'People will vote ACM. We are the new dawn' Last week, political parties contesting the 2019 elections signed an agreement to uphold the IEC's values during the polls.  Hlaudi took to the stage to say he was positive people would vote his party into government. 'I'm a born intellectual, not an academic one' Hlaudi told journalists during his labour court battle with the SABC that he had "been at Wits because I am an intellectual lecture, not an academic one".
