Flamboyant media personality Somizi Mhlongo will join #TheBridge team on Metro FM from tomorrow. Mhlongo, who was presenting the weekly #FreshBreakfast from 5am to 9am with co-host DJ Fresh on the same station, will be replaced by former 702 Early Breakfast show presenter Relebogile Mabotja. Mhlongo will be joining Dineo Ranaka, Lerato Kganyago and Kgopedi Lilokwe on the weekly mid-morning show. The public broadcaster announced the new line-up in a statement yesterday, adding that they have recruited four big star personalities to the station. "With the new line-up, Metro has signed four big names to its stable. "The station has built onto the successes of the station's line-up by bringing on board Ayabonga Cawe, Relebogile Mabotja, Moshe Ndiki and Andile Ncube," said SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu. Actor Ndiki will join The Drive show with Moeti "MoFlava" Tsiki, Pearl Shongwe and Owen Hannie. The show was previously presented by Mashechaba Ndlovu and Mo Flava. "Proud to announce that I've joined the @METROFMSA FAMILY, hello #TheDrive. Thank you God, thank you mom and thank you to all of you who've supported everything I do," said Ndiki on his Twitter account. Ncube will present sports for the weekend breakfast show #TheWKNDR from 6am to 9am, joining Mpho "MoG" Madise and Bujy Bikwa.
