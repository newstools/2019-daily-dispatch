Mthatha police have launched a manhunt for five armed gunmen who tried to rob a local fuel station during the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police spokesperson Captain Dineo Koena said the incident took place at the Sasol garage in Norwood around 2.30am. "They allegedly held staff at gunpoint and ordered them to lie down on their stomachs," she said. "They demanded money but police were alerted and rushed to the scene." The would-be robbers fled without taking any money. Koena said the suspects left behind a VW Golf they were driving which was confiscated by police. An AK 47 rifle with 30 rounds was also found in the boot of the car. No arrests have been made yet but acting Mthatha cluster commander Brigadier Mandlakhe Twala said police were committed to root out the proliferation of illegal firearms within the cluster. "We are committed to ensure that they(would-be armed robbers will be arrested and brought to book," he added. Koena meanwhile said the recovered weapon would be sent for ballistic tests to try and link it to other crimes reported previously. The police will also try to link the vehicle to previously-reported armed robberies. sikhon@dispatch.co.za
