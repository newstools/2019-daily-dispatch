Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is expected to offer more explosive testimony when he returns to the stand at the state capture inquiry on Friday. On Thursday,Â Agrizzi gave details about the alleged corrupt relationship between the controversial prisons facilities company and environmental affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Agrizzi disclosed two instances in which he was present when company boss Gavin Watson allegedly handed R50,000 over to Mokonyane in a bag. Agrizzi, who is appearing before the commission for a second round of testimony, spent the morning clearing up questions which emerged from his initial evidence before the commission and corroborating information provided by some of his former colleagues. This is not the first time Agrizzi has claimed that Mokonyane received  monthly payments from Bosasa. When he first appeared before the commission in January, he said the monthly payments continued for almost a decade and that Bosasa footed the bill for other "ridiculous requests", like Mokonyane's Christmas shopping, rallies for the ANC, food for party events, routine maintenance to her home and rental cars for her daughter.
