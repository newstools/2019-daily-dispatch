Hundreds of Walter Sisulu University students are demonstrating around Southernwood in East London this afternoon. They will later make their way to the office of the Chief Financial Officer of the university in town. Students at the Buffalo City campus have been boycotting classes since Thursday last week over non-payment of NSFAS allowances. SRC secretary Samkele Mqai told DispatchLIVE that majority of students at the university have not received their allowances. “We want the university to speed up the process of distributing the allowances,” he said.
