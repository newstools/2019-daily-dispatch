Disgruntled ANC members and supporters disrupted a Buffalo City Metro council meeting on Wednesday calling for the removal of ward 20 councillor Ntombizodwa Gamnca. They started chanting during a heated debate over the Municipal Public Accounts Committee 2017-2018 annual report. The protesters are calling for Gamnca to remove herself from the meeting, who was in attendance. On Tuesday the Dispatch the reported that the ANC provincial executive committee had suspended Gamnca following fraud and corruption allegations made against by Mdantsane residents who accused her of illegally selling houses in the township. The protesters chanted in the gallery accusing Gamnca of being a liar and a thief. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi told DispatchLIVE: “The ANC will proceed with its disciplinary processes as planned.” The protest eventually forced the councillors to adjourn for an early lunch.
