DA leader Mmusi Maimane's comment on the alleged abuse of Babes Wodumo has landed him in trouble on social media. The video, which was posted by Babes in her Instagram account, purports to show her being physically abused by her long-time boyfriend, Mampintsha. Responding to a Twitter user Mbali Ntuli, who had shared the video on the platform, Maimane took to the comments to challenge Mampintsha to three rounds in a boxing ring, saying the musicians behaviour makes him "sick". His comment stirred a mixed bag of reactions as some simply laughed it off, saying he won't stand a chance, while some accused him of promoting the very cancerous social ill which is violence. Tweeps flooded the comments section. Here are some of the reactions:
