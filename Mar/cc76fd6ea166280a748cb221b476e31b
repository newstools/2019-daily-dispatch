SA Airways (SAA) has warned passengers travelling to the US about additional restrictions on carrying liquids, aerosols and gels in their cabin baggage as of Monday. SAA has two flights daily to Washington DC and to New York. The flight to New York is non-stop, while the flight to Washington DC goes via Accra and Dakar - four and three times a week respectively. "In terms of the US's Transportation Security Administration (TSA), there will be additional security requirements for flights to the US and these will be in the form of restrictions on carrying certain specified items in the cabin under specified circumstances," said SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali. "These restrictions are imposed on all passengers in transit/transfer to the US and will apply to both SAA flights to the US. Tlali said passengers were advised to take the new restrictions into consideration when planning to transit or transfer through Johannesburg, Accra and Dakar to avoid unnecessary discomfort or possible loss of their items. "SAA apologises for any inconvenience that could result from the restrictions imposed. We trust that our discerning passengers will appreciate that from time to time there will be changes introduced in the industry by the regulators or by agencies of jurisdictions in which SAA operates. These measures are aimed at improving security and safety of all across the value chain," said Tlali. SAA said it would verify all duty-free items purchased at upstream airports and would  deny the carriage of such items on flights to the US.
