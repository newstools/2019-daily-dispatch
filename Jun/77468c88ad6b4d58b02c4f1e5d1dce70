President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the annual State of the National Address (SONA) later this evening. Normally there would be only one address by the president but this will be the second SONA this year, following elections and his swearing in as the republic's president. According to parliament, the Sona gala dinner will not take place. Parliament says the Sona budget has been slashed by 47% compared to the 2018 Sona.
