Disgruntled residents from Buffalo City Metro’s ward 10 staged a silent protest on Wednesday; disrupting a council meeting in session. At the centre of the protest were complaints about ward councillor Roseline Vitbooi who is accused of hiring only “her people” in community projects. The projects are part of the R700 000 ward allocation funding that was awarded to all 50 wards.
