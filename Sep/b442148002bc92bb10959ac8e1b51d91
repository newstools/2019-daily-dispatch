Hundreds of mourners paid their last tribute to killed boxing and karate champion, Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels in East London on Saturday. Jegels was shot dead two weeks ago by her police boyfriend, whom she had a protection order against. Politicians, boxing personalities, and sports fans attended Jegels’ funeral service at the East London City Hall, where she was described as a “beautiful angel”. Speaker after speaker described Jegels as a person who was loved deeply in the karate and boxing fraternity. Boxing SA’s Dr Peter Ngatane said the country lost a boxer who was on the verge of changing the sport. “We were looking forward to have her staying in boxing. We lost an ambassador as the sport.” He said Jegels was beautiful and disciplined. Her karate coach, Stephen Martin, described Jegels as true role model. “We can’t change what happened but the truth is we’ve lost a role model who was loved by many," Martin said. As the funeral procession was making its way from Buffalo Flats to the city hall, more than hundred vehicles lined up. Roads were closed and people were visible upset, while her relatives could not hold their tears as her casket, draped in the SA flag left the church hall. At the fully packed city hall, mourners all sang the national anthem. A crying Mandisi Apleni said: “Is this the life we need to live in this country, what is this message we are passing?” Buffalo City Metro mayor Xola Pakati said more was needed to be done to end gender-based violence.
