One person has died while two other were seriously injured after a bakkie carrying 12 passengers collided with a tipper truck on the R72 road between East London and Kidds Beach near the Winterstrand turn-off on Wednesday. Department of transport provincial spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, said it was alleged that the truck was making a right turn into a construction site when the accident happened. “The passenger on the front seat of the bakkie died on impact while the driver and another passenger sustained serious injuries. The truck driver escaped unscathed,” he said. Binqose said the injuries in the accidents ranged from minor to serious. “Two dogs were unharmed in the accident and were taken to the SPCA. A case of culpable homicide has been opened,” he said.
