A huge fire is burning in the Stones Hill/Port Alfred Road area of Makana municipality. Just after 7pm on Friday, Makana spokesperson Anele Mjekula told the Dispatch that it was a “very large area” burning in the direction of Port Alfred. “The fire is still burning on both sides of the road. We are protecting Mt Haggard's farm, Tuskers Lodge and Whispering Mist. We are being assisted by Ndlambe and Sarah Baartman (municipalities) and and St Andrew's College has provided a vehicle to assist,” Mjekula said. St Andrew's also provided staff to help fight the fire. This is a developing story.
