Mthatha is the sixth most dangerous city in SA where you are most likely to be murdered, police minister Bheki Cele revealed while releasing crime statistics in parliament on Thursday morning. Cele announced that most violent crimes in the country had gone up during the 2018/19 financial year. A total of 617, 210 contact crimes were reported in the year under review when compared to last year’s 601,36, the statistics showed. Cele revealed the 10 stations that recorded the most number of murder cases were Nyanga, Delft, Khayelitsha all in the Western Cape, Inanda in Kwazulu-Natal, Philippi East in the Western Cape, Mthatha, Umlazi in KZN, Harare in the Western Cape, Plessislaer in KZN and Gugulethu in the Western Cape. Cele said: “Last year I said we dropped the ball and that we would either reduce or maintain the murder rate. I am here to say that the crime stats are not looking good, however they look much better than last year in most categories.” There were 21,022 murder cases reported in the country last year, a 3.4 % increase from last year’s 20,336 murders. Sexual offenses had also increased from 50,108 to 52,420, while attempted murder had also risen from 18,233 to 18,980.
