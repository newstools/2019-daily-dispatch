A 17-point burst in less than 10 minutes in the first half set New Zealand on course for victory over South Africa in their much anticipated Rugby World Cup clash  on Saturday. The All Blacks won 23-13 to take early control of Pool B. Tries by George Bridge and Scott Barrett gave the All Blacks a cushion before the Springboks rallied in the second half. A converted try by Pieter-Steph du Toit and a drop goal by Handre Pollard got them within striking distance but the All Blacks added two penalties by Richie Mo’unga and Beauden Barrett to restore their buffer.
