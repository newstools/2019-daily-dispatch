Scores of UCT students had to be offered counselling on Saturday when they could not contain their emotions during the funeral of Uyinene Mrwetyana at Abbordsford Christian Centre. Standing around the coffin, the students cried as student representative council chairperson Asanda Lobelo delivered an emotional tribute on behalf of the students. Lobelo, who was also crying, said students were struggling to deal with Uyineneâ€™s death.
