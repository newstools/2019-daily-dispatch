The Gonubie traffic department was broken into on the weekend for the second time since June. Thieves used grinders to get into two safes and made off with documents and money. Buffalo City Metro spokesperson Samuel Ngwenya said forensic experts discovered that alarm wires were cut before the thieves piled in. “We are still waiting for forensics to comb the scene because no one is allowed in the building. We can only give a full report when forensics is done to see what is missing,” he said. Ngwenya said the robbery was well planned. “We will undertake our own internal investigation as we have beefed up security in the premises including having physical security personnel,” he said. Ngwenya allayed fears of the public, saying “Our electronic system is well equipped to pick up any fraudulent tampering.”
