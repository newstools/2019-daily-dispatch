About 400 angry Ngcobo villagers picketed in front of the Dalasile magistrate’s court on Tuesday demanding that three primary school staff members accused of raping three male pupils be denied bail. The three staff members appeared individually in court, and did not plead. Police spokesperson Capt Namhla Mdleni said the staff members were arrested on Sunday for allegedly luring three boys, aged between 14 and 17, to their homes on the pretence of helping them with their homework before plying them with alcohol and raping them. Prosecutor Sikho Ndika said the three had been charged with rape. “This is a schedule six offence as all the victims are minors,” Ndika said. If found guilty, they could receive sentences of between 15 years and life in jail. Among the hundreds of angry protesters gathered outside the court were the parents of the boys, as well as ANC MPL Tumeka Gaya and Engcobo municipality chief whip Nobantu Macingwana. Gaya raised concerns that teachers from the school, including the school principal, did not attend the case. “We are dismayed at these serious allegations levelled at teachers. “We just hope that the law will take its course. “We are also concerned that teachers chose not to be part of this gathering while three of the learners have been victims of rape and that three of their staff members stand accused of the crime,” Gaya said. “So the school has six people directly affected but the school management and teachers chose not to pledge solidarity and show that they are hurt by this incident. “We are here to support the call for no bail,” he said. Parents of the victims said their children had become withdrawn and were afraid to return to school. “They are now scared to go to school and are also afraid to be mocked by their fellow learners,” a distraught parent said. The case was postponed to September 27 for formal bail applications.
