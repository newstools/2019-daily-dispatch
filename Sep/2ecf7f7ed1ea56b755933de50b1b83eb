Gospel singer and businessman Sbusiso Mabena has raised R10m to assist young people who want to open their own businesses. Mabena plans to channel the money to exciting and innovative proposals of young and unemployed people through a television show. Titled Isinamva Liyabukwa, the  show  is looking for people from the ages of 18 to 40. The show will hit the small screen in March next year on Moja Love, channel 157, but the proposals are now open. Mabena is looking for 200 proposals of small and big business ideas. He told Sowetan that he was encouraged  to assist young people because of the high level of unemployment in the country of both educated and uneducated people. “I have always been a giving person, and those who know me well know that this is a calling for me. I decided to have this show because people are not working. It is even more depressing for people who have degrees and cannot find jobs,” he said. “What I am saying is that those who have ideas can create their own job opportunities by starting their businesses. In this way they can also employ others.” Mabena, who owns Versatile Transporting Mining company,  has hired a group of professionals who will go through the proposals that will be sent through e-mails. He says that those who don’t have the “know how” of business will be taken through a workshop to assist them. “We are not planning to turn down people who show hunger and passion for business though they do not understand [it]. Those who managed to open their businesses will be revisited to see their progress.” The gospel star, who was born and bred in Dennilton in Limpopo, started out as a dancer and backing vocalist for artists such as Tsekeleke, Trompies and Mandla Spikiri Mofokeng, among others. Mabena is also set to record his first live worship album and DVD next month at  Carnival City in Brakpan.
