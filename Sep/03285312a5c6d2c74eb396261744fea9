It is being hosted by the sport, recreation, arts and culture department in under the theme “Siqhayisa ngengoma - the battle of Maskhandi”. Maskhandi has grown in the Eastern Cape over the years and many community members have turned to love this genre due to the influence of the late Umhlobo Wenene multiple-award winning presenter Saba Mbixana’s programmes, “Lavuth’ibhayi” and “Siwel’uthukela”.
