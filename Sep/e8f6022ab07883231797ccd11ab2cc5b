Former Duncan Village prospect Nhlanhla “24” Ngamntwini breathed massive life into his floundering career when he scored a highlight reel second-round knockout over previously unbeaten amateur star Mzwabantu Mbexeshi in a bantamweight clash at ICC in East London on Saturday night. After a tentative first round in which action resembled a sparring session, Ngamntwini exploded with a counter left hook to drop Mbexeshi badly. Mbexeshi twitched his legs while prone on the canvas forcing the referee to immediately wave the fight over as medical personnel rushed to the ring. But Mbexeshi recovered and walked out the ring unaided. The win was the second for Ngamntwini after his fourth round knockout defeat by Mexican journeyman Ulises Lara which was as spectacular as the one he scored over Mbexeshi. He also knocked out Mfundo Gwayana in his previous bout. Unbeaten DRC-born junior middleweight Emamany Kalambo scored a fourth-round stoppage over Henriques Lando of Angola. The bout featured heavy exchanges of artillery until Kalambo varied his attack to the body. Lando dropped his guards to protect his midsection opening upstairs to Kalambo’s missiles. Ayanda Ndulani lifted the ABU mini-flyweight title with a scrappy unanimous decision win over Loyiso Ngantweni
