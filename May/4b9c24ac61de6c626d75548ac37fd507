African heads of state that will be part of the event include Rwandan President Paul Kagame, Uganda President Yoweri Museveni, Tanzanian President John Magufuli andNamibian President Hage Geingob, among others. Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa will also attend the event. ESwatini’s King Mswati and Lesotho’s King Letsie will also be part of the event.
