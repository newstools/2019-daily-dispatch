World cup fever is contagious and Eastern Capers are not being left out of the explosion of support for the Springboks ahead of this week's Rugby World Cup final against England. From school children to sports personalities and supermarket workers, people of the province have been shouting, singing, dancing and even surfing to show that they are behind our national team. The Border Bulldogs wished their former teammates Makazole Mapimpi, and Lukhanyo Am and the Springboks well ahead of the World Cup final against England in Japan on Saturday. Legendary East London ex world champion surfer Greg Emslie gave a unique shoutout to the Boks from the waves. A video shared on the #ImStaying Facebook group showing staff at Spargs Beacon Bay dancing and singing Shosholoza in honour of the Springboks.
