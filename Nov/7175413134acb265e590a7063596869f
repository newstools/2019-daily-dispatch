A small but prominent traffic island at Gonubie beachfront has been given a makeover by local residents. The traffic island, which is at the entrance to the parking lot opposite the Gonubie Hotel, looked the worse for wear for several years, drawing attention for all the wrong reasons. But, after discussions between the Gonubie ratepayers and residents association and local ward councillor, Andre Swart, wheels were set in motion to beautify the island. Ratepayers chair Henri Smit said: “We were given the green light by BCM to go ahead. We got to work on the project. A resident designed the feature, and with the support of several local businesses, we were able to put the new feature in place. A contractor also fixed the edges of the island.” The difference to the island is plain to see. Where before a dead aloe tree lay in the dirt, there is now a colourful rock garden complete with green foliage and pot plants of flowers, finished off with three wooden frames providing a nice aesthetic touch. “We had brought it up a few times in ratepayer meetings, but we finally decided to move on it. I think it will contribute to tourism in Gonubie. It’s something nice and positive,” Smit said. “We thank everyone that was involved in helping us  do this — Wayne, Heloise, Lunthu, Bulelani, Louis for the aloe tree, Adel, Titiba, Gerda from Seaforth Guest House for the road marking paint, and Dalena Properties for the pots. “We also thank Jurgen from Ezulwini Civils and Construction for fixing the concrete curves, Henri Smit from AH Electrical for the rock curtain and plants and Elna for the design and layout of the garden. A special thank you to the Gonubie Hotel for refreshments and to Andre, our councillor, for his assistance.” johnh@dispatch.co.za
