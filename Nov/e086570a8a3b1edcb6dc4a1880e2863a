The DA elected John Steenhuisen as its interim leader at the party's federal council meeting on Sunday. After Mmusi Maimane's resignation as head of the party, two candidates were gunning for the position. Steenhuisen beat Makashule Gana. He promised to turn the DA's recent setbacks into comebacks and is positive the party  is the best way to drive SA towards anti-corruption and unity. Ivan Meyer was elected federal chair.
