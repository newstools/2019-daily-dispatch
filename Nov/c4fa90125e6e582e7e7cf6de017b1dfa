Springbok player Lukhanyo Am was given a superstar's welcome in his King William’s Town hometown on Saturday as hundreds of Zwelitsha residents, young and old cheered for him as a motorcade criss-crossed the town's streets. Am, an instrumental player in winning the Rugby World Cup earlier this month in Japan, waved at the crowd made up of his family, neighbours and his former Border coach Thobile Mtya. The 25-year-old said the welcoming celebration organised by his Zone One community was overwhelming. “Emotions are high at the moment. It feels really special to be home, with all the support from the community, ” said Am. Mtya expressed how proud he is of Am. “I always saw potential in him, but I didn't know it would be this quick. He was always a disciplined player and to welcome him here today means a lot to me as his former coach,” said Mtya. Young rugby players said they were motivated to keep playing rugby as they welcomed their hero. Shafic Ntlebi, 13, said: ” He represented us well as Zwelitsha residents and put our area on the map.” ziyandaz@dispatch.co.za
