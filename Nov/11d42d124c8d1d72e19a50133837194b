No cases of theft or violence were reported during Black Friday, but police still issued a warning, using loudhailers,  to shoppers splurging across the province  to be vigilant. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni said police members had been deployed as part of Operation Buya Mthetho to enhance  visibility and combat crime at  malls. “We appeal to the public to exercise caution for opportunistic criminals who will be looking for unsuspecting victims,” Tonjeni said. “In various clusters we have loudhailers to remind shoppers and social grant beneficiaries to be on high alert. “Those carrying large sums of money are encouraged to also consider other banking options like electronic and cellphone banking to minimise loss and exposure to crime and robbery. Mthatha, Komani, King William’s Town and East London cluster  spokespersons confirmed to the Dispatch that no cases of robbery and theft had been reported by Friday morning. Uniformed police were seen  keeping a close eye  on the shopping masses. Cambridge police spokesperson Captain Mluleki Mbi said police in East London had started patrolling on Thursday at 10pm. “We will continue until tomorrow [Saturday],”  Mbi said. “Police are looking to curb any distraction that may happen. “There is police visibility everywhere.” Mthatha cluster spokesperson Captain Dineo Koena said they were concerned  shoppers would be mugged. “We are  keeping the shops safe,” she said. Tonjeni urged residents to report all crime incidents to police immediately. ziyandaz@dispatch.co.za
