A Scottish man has received flak after a video of him shooting a firework from his rear-end emerged on Twitter on Monday. The incident seems to have taken place in a private garden. In the video, the man can be seen with the firework protruding from his rear, before quickly letting it drop once the flames start shooting. Members of the UK's health and safety have condemned the incident as reckless.
