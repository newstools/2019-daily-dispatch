The Xhosa royal family and AmaTshawe ruling clan will on Sunday morning  remove the body of amaXhosa monarch, King Mpendulo Calvin Zwelonke Sigcawu, from the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital morgue in Mthatha to a Dutywa private parlour where it will be kept until burial on November 29. This was announced by family royal spokespersons Nkosi Xhanti Sigcawu, and Prince Zolile Burns-Ncamashe after discussions were held between the royal family and AmaTshawe in Nqadu Great Place near Willowvale on Saturday. His body has remained in the hospital mortuary since he passed shortly after 5am on Thursday subsequent to his 6pm Wednesday admission. Both the main houses of King Phalo — AmaGcaleka and AmaRharhabe — and other AmaTshawe are mourning together as one royal family. They are jointly making decisions on the customary issues, including burial and identifying a successor or regent, and relevant rituals and practices to be followed in accordance to Xhosa customary practices. In a media briefing Xhanti and Burns-Ncamashe said a delegation from Nqadu Great Place would meet to form a motorcade in Dutywa  and from 10am proceed to Mthatha, expecting to arrive at the hospital shortly before 11am. “As His Majesty King Zwelonke passed on at the hospital and not at home, a ritual of spirit repatriation will be conducted by the elders of AmaTshawe and church leaders at the hospital,” said Xhanti Burns-Ncamashe and Xhanti said a hearse will transport the body to Nqadu, firstly to the king's reception palace and then his private palace before being taken a private parlour in Dutywa. Prayers services will be held in Nqadu. On Monday AmaRharhabe Queen Noloyiso Sandile, her son Crown Prince Jonguxolo Sandile, and her entourage will travel from Mngqesha Great Place near King William's Town to lead the process of officially pronouncing on the successor after she has thoroughly consulted with the royal family. lulamilef@dispatch.coza
