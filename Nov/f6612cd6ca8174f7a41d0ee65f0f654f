China's SUV maker Great Wall Motor said on Friday the local regulator had approved its auto manufacturing project with German premium carmaker BMW. The project, with a total investment of 5.1bn yuan (roughly R10.65bn), will have annual capacity of 160,000 combustion engine cars for export, according to a Great Wall filing on Shanghai Stock Exchange. Great Wall and BMW said in 2018 they plan to launch a joint venture to make new energy vehicles in China.
