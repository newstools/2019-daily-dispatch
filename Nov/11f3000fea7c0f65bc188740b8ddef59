The best way to honour the memory of 51-year-old AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu is for his successor and the ruling AmaTshawe dynasty to embrace and continue with his legacy of developing his community and sport. Internally, his successor must continue to strengthen unity among AmaTshawe, especially AmaGcaleka and AmaRharhabe, the two main houses of King Phalo. Zwelonke  established the AmaTshawe Joint Committee, and made sure that the  executive included members from both AmaGcaleka and AmaRharhabe. He passion for uniting AmaTshawe was triggered by the ill-treatment  the two houses suffered under the apartheid system and it’s repugnant and fake “independent” homeland system, which had as its  basis the fostering of animosity between the houses. The king apparently listened to the wisdom of his elderly mother, Queen Nozamile Sigcawu, who advised him to prioritise  unity between  AmaGcaleka and AmaRharhabe. In his 13 years on the throne, Zwelonke championed rural development, youth upliftment  and the development of education, health, tourism and agriculture. He drove the campaign for  poor rural young girls to receive sanitary towels, gathering donations and  personally delivering them to schools. The king was a caring father who loved his  daughters. He adopted some schools and donated computers and tablets. He urged  the education department to provide schools with  maths and science teachers. He was in the process of having a hall and hostel built for the King Xolilizwe High School, which draws hundreds of pupils from villages around Dutywa and Willowvale. Zwelenkosi  adopted the Thafalofefe Hospital in Centane and went on to donate hundreds of blankets and a number of TV sets for patients, as well as have the walls of the hospital painted. The king was also passionate about farming, and this he supported with his House of Phalo Legacy Initiative. He used the King Zwelonke Foundation to drive all these initiatives. Last year he launched  the King Zwelonke Legacy Project to assist his nation in eradicating poverty and empower his subjects with skills.
