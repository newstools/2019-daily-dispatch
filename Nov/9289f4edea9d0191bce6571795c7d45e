Idols SA season 15 winner Luyolo Yiba’s homecoming celebrations have been postponed in honour of the late AmaXhosa King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu. The celebrations, in which two cows are meant to be slaughtered, were meant to take place on Monday. It has  now been moved to December 1 — two days after the king’s funeral. The organisers, Clubview Residents Association (CRA), announced the postponement to the Dispatch on Monday. Last week, AmaXhosa royal house spokesperson Nkosi Xhanti Sigcawu announced that the king would be mourned for a year. He said  all celebrations, including initiations and weddings, should be postponed. CRA spokesperson Zama Dayile said: “We have decided to heed the call from the royal house and postpone the celebrations until after the funeral. However this doesn’t mean that we won’t fetch him from the airport, but we won’t be making the same noise that we will make after the funeral. The mood will be sombre  — a sign of respect to the fallen king,” said Dayile. Yiba touched down at East London Airport on Monday evening. Dayile said among dignitaries who would attend the December 1 celebrations, include Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane, sport MEC Fezeka Bayeni and Buffalo City mayor Xola Pakati. On November 17, some  200 Clubview residents in King William’s Town watched Yiba at a public viewing facility winning the competition and taking home R1m in cash and other prizes.
