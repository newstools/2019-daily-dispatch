These were just come of the tributes to the king at a memorial service held at the Nelson Mandela Museum in Mthatha on Tuesday. Nelson Mandela Museum CEO Bonke Tyhulu said the memorial service was held to pay respects to the king for  the role he played in developing his nation and creating ties with many tribes and nations in South Africa and beyond.

Nkosi Zwelicingile Manxiwa said  the king had done many thing to develop his nation in the short time he had been in throne. All speakers said that despite being a king of a nation like amaXhosa, he was down to earth. Dalindyebo said: “King Sigcawu was a beacon of hope for traditional leadership in the Eastern Cape. He was prepared to give guidance not only to traditional leaders, but to politicians and government officials. We shall always remember King Zwelonke as person who was passionate about development.” Mvenene gave a history of amaXhosa, with specific reference to the house of Gcaleka, of which the king was a direct descendant. “He held the cultural practice of amaXhosa intact and showed unity in all the houses of amaXhosa. He comes from a family of decorated leaders who fought nine frontier wars against the colonialists who wanted to usurp the land. He has been a champion development” Manxiwa said they would ever remember Zwelonke as the king who championed the unity of all amaTshawe houses, including his ancestor King Phalo's main houses, amaGcaleka and amaRharabe.
