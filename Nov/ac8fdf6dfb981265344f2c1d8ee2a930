Buffalo City Metro caucus chief whip Dharmesh Dhaya has withdrawn his candidacy for the interim DA federal chair position, saying he wants to focus on local government — for now. This leaves DA Women’s Network (Dawn) federal leader and Western Cape health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo, DA Western Cape MPL Ivan Meyer and Gauteng MPL Khume Ramulifho in the running for the position. The position will be filled on Sunday when the DA holds its federal council meeting at its Johannesburg headquarters, Nkululeko House. Confirming his withdrawal on Thursday, Dhaya said: “I was just testing the waters when I threw my name in the hat. After careful consideration, I decided at this stage, it is best for me to concentrate on local and regional politics.”
