The commission of inquiry into state capture resumes with evidence from the former Minister of International Relations and Corporation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Her testimony will focus on the landing of the Gupta private plane at the Waterkloof Airforce Base in Pretoria in 2013. Nkoana-Mashabane - now the minister of Women in the Presidency - will also explain why Bruce Koloane, former Chief of State Protocol at Waterkloof who was behind the controversial landing of the plane - was after the incident promoted to be South Africa's ambassador to the Netherlands. Koloane has since resigned from that position.
