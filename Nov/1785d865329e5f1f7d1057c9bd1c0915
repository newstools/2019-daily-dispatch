A floating dock to be utilised in the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) dry dock caisson gate refurbishment project left Durban harbour on Friday and is expected to arrive in East London harbour on Sunday. The gate at East London harbour will be taken out and floated onto the floating dock from Durban, then lifted so it can be refurbished. The caisson is a large steel gate structure that closes the dock off from the sea water allowing for the docking and repair of vessels inside the facility. “We have been hard at work advancing these critical projects through Transnet’s governance and procurement processes, and are now pleased to be at the stage of actual execution of our refurbishment of the dry dock’s caisson,” said East London port manager Sharon Sijako. The dry dock is expected to be out of commission until early December. The 72-year old dry dock was opened officially by Princess Elizabeth on March 3 1947. Earlier this year, TNPA contracted company H.R. Morgan (Pty) Ltd t/a Oilco Border Engineering to carry out a R10.6m refurbishment of the dry dock’s main shut-off valves which flood and empty the dock of water. The caisson repair project costs are R47m.
