Award-winning UK grime superstar Stormzy is heading to SA. The muso, who has nearly single-handedly taken the underground electronic dance and hip hop genre to the world, will headline the Rocking The Daisies Music Festival next year. The festival runs from 2 until 4 October 2020, with limited tickets now on sale at a cost of R595. The 26-year-old has topped charts with his hits, including Vossi Bop, Big for Your Boots, Cigarettes & Cush and Blinded by Your Grace, Pt. 2. He made history earlier this year when he became the first-ever UK rapper to headline the prestigious Glastonbury Music Festival.
