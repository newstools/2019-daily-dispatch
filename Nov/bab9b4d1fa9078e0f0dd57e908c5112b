The ANC in the Amathole district has called for President Cyril Ramaphosa,  Correctional Services and Justice Minister Ronald Lamola to allow jailed abaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, to attend the funeral of late  amaXhosa king Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu on Friday. Dalindyebo is serving an effective 12 years in prison, imposed by the Supreme Court of Appeal in October 2015. The sentence was handed down for three counts of arson, three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, one count of defeating the ends of justice and one count of kidnapping. ANC Amathole regional secretary Thembalethu Ntuthu said   prisoners are allowed to apply for compassionate leave to attend funerals of their direct relatives. Ramaphosa is to deliver a eulogy at the funeral which he  declared a Special Official Funeral Category 1 and the ANC in the Amathole region feels  that granting Dalindyebo permission to attend would  honour  Sigcawu, who had  been the most vocal in calling for the release of Dalindyebo. “The call for King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo to be granted compassionate leave, must however, not be construed as a call for his unconditional release from prison,” Ntuthi told DispatchLIVE. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
