The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday dismissed with costs former president Jacob Zuma's leave to appeal. Zuma and French arms company Thales were appealing the decision to dismiss their application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane argued last Friday that in rejecting Zuma's bid for a permanent stay of prosecution, three KwaZulu-Natal judges had ignored “the prejudicial conduct of the National Prosecuting Authority” towards him. Judgment was reserved for a decision. This is a developing story.
