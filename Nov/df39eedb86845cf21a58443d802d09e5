The first ever Eastern Cape Idols SA winner is home. King Williams Town’s Luyolo Yiba who has captured the hearts of millions of South Africans arrived to a packed and vibrant East London Airport on Monday evening. Hundreds of supporters along with Yiba’s father, grandmother and other family members were singing and dancing waiting on his arrival. The delayed flight from OR Tambo was no deterrent for the supporters as they were in high spirits throughout. As soon as the 24-year-old winner walked through the doors, the airport erupted with ululating and cheering! Yiba has been in Joburg since he was announced as the winner of season 15 earlier this month at the Big Top Arena at Carnival City. gugup@dispatch.co.za
