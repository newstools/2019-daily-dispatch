The DA has elected John Steenhuisen as the party's interim leader. The DA's Ivan Meyer was elected interim federal chairperson. The party's national spokesperson, Solly Malatjie, confirmed the news on his Twitter account. Steenhuisen, who replaces former party leader Mmusi Maimane, was up against member of the Gauteng provincial legislature Makashule Gana after Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela pulled out of the race. Maimane left the DA in shambles after he resigned from the party following its poor election performance in the national elections in May.
