Lewin served seven years in prison for sabotage after being detained by the security police in 1964 and wrote his memoir in an attempt to come to terms with his betrayal by his best friend. He also received the Olive Schreiner prize for Bandiet out of Jail‚ his account of his time in Pretoria prison.
