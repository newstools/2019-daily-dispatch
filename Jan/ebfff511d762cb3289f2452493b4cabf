If there's one thing we should know by now‚ it is that children are the future. These kids - who sure look like stars in the making - gave us such warm feels with their dance attempts‚ that we couldn't help but smile all the way into 2019. That time we all learnt that Elvis Presley may have died‚ but he also multiplied...A video of an eight-year-old Kempton Park schoolboy dancing has gone viral‚ with over 300‚000 views so far. Joshua Ziervogel is a student at Laerskool Van RiebeeckPark Primary and was the lead in a school production. His performance to Redfoo's Juicy Wiggle has drawn major applause‚ with many comparing his dance moves to Elvis. This lil cutie pie proved that you can gwara gwara to anything reallyAfter we watched from the sidelines for ages as the gwara gwara took over the world‚ we were convinced that it should be declared the dance of the country. But it was Joyous Celebration gospel artist Sibusiso Desmond Mthembu‚ famously known as SbuNoah‚ who opened our eyes to the dance being a perfect fit for gospel music. He shared a clip of primary school kids breaking down to his latest single‚ Wenzile.  That E'froo E'E'froo vosho moment was too hilarious!Sometimes in Mzansi kuba tense'nyana‚ but then clips like the one you're about to see‚ really is a sight for sore eyes and might even make your day. Okay‚ so it won't fix the expropriation of land without compensation tension and the exchange rate‚ but the attempts by this group of little girls to sing Tipcee's iScathulo featuring Busiswa‚ DJ Tira & Distruction Boyz is super cute!
