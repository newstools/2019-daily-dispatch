Mdantsane resident Nandipha Kewuti’s entry was picked out of thousands of readers who entered the Daily Dispatch Win-A-Car competition in association with Buffalo Toyota. Kewuti is now the owner of the brand new Toyota Aygo Xplay. She will receive the car next week. The competition ran for six weeks, from August 17 to September 29, and saw entries almost double compared to last year. Daily Dispatch marketing manager Jennilee Peremore-Oliver said: “We haven’t calculated all the entries yet, but we’ve had substantially more entries than last year.” She said the competition had been running annually for several years and was a way for the Dispatch to reward its readers. Peremore-Oliver said: “It’s a way for us to say thank you to our loyal readers for their support, for buying the paper every day and for being a part of the Daily Dispatch family. “Not everyone can win the car, but everyone has the opportunity to try out and enter the competition.” This year’s winner will get to enjoy the Toyota Aygo Xplay with a sleek black body and silver roof. Buffalo Toyota EL representative, Tristen van der Vyver said the car had great entertainment features, including a touch screen audio system, USB, aux input and bluetooth connectivity features. “Its fuel consumption is also phenomenal, which makes it a great city car,” said Van der Vyver on Tuesday. — Madeleine Chaput
