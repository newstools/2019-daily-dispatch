Eastern Province batted themselves into a strong position at tea in their CSA 3-Day Provincial Challenge match against Border at Buffalo Park on Thursday afternoon. A quick-fire 48-run stand between Thomas Kaber and Tian Koekemoer led the visitors to 208/4 at the break, with the possibility of reaching a good total by the end of play. Border managed only two wickets during the session, both to spinner Bongolwethu Makeleni. He first ended a 42-run stand between Matthew Christensen and Kelly Smuts, having Smuts caught behind by wicketkeeper Mncedisi Malika for 23. Christensen was then joined by Koekemoer and they added 35, during which time Christensen brought up a hard-earned half century before he was trapped LBW by Makeleni to fall for 73 off 167 balls (12x4) with EP on 160/4. Kaber then joined Koekemoer, who was on 15, and by the time they reached tea Kaber, on 30, had almost caught Koekemoer, who was on 32. Border will now be desperate to pick up a few quick wickets in the final session and try to limit EP as much as possible.
