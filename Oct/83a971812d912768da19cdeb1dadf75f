Eskom on Wednesday announced that stage 2 load-shedding is likely to be implemented from 9am to 11pm. The power alert stated this is “due to a shortage of capacity”. Energy expert Chris Yelland said he was receiving information of “major Eskom generation capacity supply shortages as unplanned generation breakdowns (UCLF) spiked yesterday and continue today.” Yelland tweeted that he had been told of one reactor down at Koeberg, four units down with boiler tube leaks, a problem at Grootvlei, and a conveyor down from Grootegeluk to Matimba. Last month, Eskom communicated that “while no load-shedding is expected over summer, the risk however remains as the system is still tight and vulnerable, as we ramp up plant maintenance. Eskom continues to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly.” Rotational power cuts were also implemented in March this year. Eskom previously introduced nationwide blackouts in 2015 and 2018. This week, President Cyril Ramaphosa told a Financial Times conference in London that the government is poised to overhaul the executive management, strengthen the board and address the company’s spiralling debt. Wednesday's cabinet meeting is expected to discuss what plans government has in mind to save the cash-strapped, mismanaged state owned entity. The market hope is that both the long-awaited energy blueprint and the much-anticipated paper on Eskom's restructuring could be published as early as this week.
