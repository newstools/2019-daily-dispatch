A rhino bull was found dead on a game farm outside Makhanda on Tuesday. This is the second poaching incident in the Eastern Cape in 2019. The dead rhino was found about 40km from Makhanda along the Bushmans River. About four years old, it had been dead for several days. It is believed it died from septicaemia after being shot. Police spokesperson Colonel Sibongile Soci said both horns were intact but the incident is still recorded under poaching. In 2018, 19 rhinos were killed in the Eastern Cape. Earlier this year a rhino was poached at the Shamwari Game Reserve. wilsong@tisoblackstar.co.za
