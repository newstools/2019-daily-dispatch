A video shared on the #ImStaying Facebook group showing staff at Spargs Beacon Bay dancing and singing Shosholoza in honour of the Springboks has been spreading across social media like wildfire. South Africans from all corners of the country sang and danced as the Bokke came one step closer to lifting the World Cup. The Springboks recorded a 19-16 win against Wales and will face England on Saturday November 2 at Yokohoma in Japan. DispatchLIVE reported that the team's coach, Rassie Erasmus, believes the team has the potential to win the final. “I think we are in with a chance. We have a six-day turnaround [after the Wales game]. I’m not 100% sure whether the Rugby World Cup final will be won by a very expansive game plan. It might be. I might be wrong. But we’ll go and grind it out.” Alison Tucker, who shared the video, captioned it: “Go Bokke! Staff getting into the spirit of the big weekend to come with a hearty flash mob.”
