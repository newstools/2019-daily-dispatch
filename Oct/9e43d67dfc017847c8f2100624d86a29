England produced an outstanding performance to shock defending champions New Zealand 19-7 in a pulsating Rugby World Cup semi-final in Yokohama on Saturday. A try by centre Manu Tuilagi put England ahead with less than two minutes on the clock and the All Blacks never got back into the game, losing their first World Cup match since 2007.
