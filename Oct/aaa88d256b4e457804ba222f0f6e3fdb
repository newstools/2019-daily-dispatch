The bodies of two missing teenagers, believed to have drowned on Sunday morning at Eastern Beach, have still not been found, according to Buffalo City Municipality spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya.Ngwenya said the search had commenced on Monday morning, but that by Monday afternoon at 3pm there had been no breakthrough yet. “The operation has changed from rescuing to recovery now, but there has been no discovery or wash up of any bodies so far,” Ngwenya said.The incident, in which three teenagers on a school tour from Middelburg were seen struggling in the rip current, took place just after 8am on Sunday morning. One of the three youngsters was rescued by local surfers, but despite an extensive sea and shoreline search  by NSRI, firefighters, a BCM dive unit, police divers and K9 search and rescue units, there was no sign of the other two.Ngwenya said the rescue operation had been called off on Sunday afternoon when rescue teams began to battle against the strong current. This incident brings the number of drownings at Eastern beach to five over the last two weeks.
