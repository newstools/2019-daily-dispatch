Black people in South Africa have been “brainwashed” into thinking they are better than other blacks across the continent. This was the hard-hitting view of Cameroonian-born Professor Enongene Mirabeau Sone, senior lecturer at Walter Sisulu University's English and African literary studies, in a debate, hosted by the Nelson Mandela Museum in Mthatha on Wednesday, on a wave of xenophobic attacks against foreign nationals in September. Nelson Mandela University-based political analyst, researcher and lecturer Ongama Mtimka drew parallels with a well-known Xhosa proverb, Unyawo alunampumlo (never say never), and warned South Africans against ill-treating foreign nationals, saying they could find their themselves in the same situation  at some point. “There are two countries bearing the name of the continent. One is the Central African Republic and the other is South Africa,” said Sone, who described the latter as a nation of great minds and leaders in the mould of Mandela and Oliver Tambo. “Mandela must be shedding tears in his grave at the way our brothers and sisters from other countries are being treated. The white man brainwashed black people into thinking that South Africans are better than other Africans.” He said xenophobia should be viewed as a crime against God and great leaders such as Mandela. He said to polish up its tarnished image, the country needed to show more commitment to the African agenda. He praised former state president Thabo Mbeki for playing a crucial role in selling the concept of the African renaissance. Mtimka said the most common causes of displacement were conflict, economic pressure and globalisation. “The pertinent question we should be asking is whether it is OK when people who have been displaced come here and we treat them badly. Because according to Xhosa wisdom the pendulum swings. There will come a time when we will find ourselves in the same position,” he added. ​ sikhon@dispatch.co.za
