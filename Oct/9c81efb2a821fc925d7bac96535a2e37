Scores of people took to social media to share concerns and frustrations over the derelict state of Nelson Mandela's Qunu farms.In his final will, Mandela wrote that it was his wish that farming operations in Qunu would continue after his death and that the NRM Family Trust would continue to employ a suitable manager to run operations.Today the farms, which are situated outside Mthatha, have been all but forgotten. Vandalism, dwindling livestock and overgrown gardens are all that is left. Many condemned the lifestyles of  Mandela's grandchildren, nieces and nephews who are  “living large” in big cities while leaving Madiba's legacy to rot. “Mandela is no more and his grandkids are living large in the big cities even those that are not Mandela's but only their mama's are,” said one social media pundit.Another  wrote: “Meanwhile the Nieces & Nephews are living large.” Others called for Mandla Mandela, Madiba's  grandson and chief of the Mvezo Traditional Council as well as other family members to take responsibility for the land. “Mandla was selected by uDalibunga himself to be the head of the family there he is supposed to take charge of everything,” one reader wrote.Another commented: “Where is his wife that house was left to her mos she must take care of her home.” Some even went as far as suggesting the family should be  “expropriated without compensation.” One commentator wrote: “The community must expropriate them!” Others touched on the wasted farming opportunities, suggesting the Eastern Cape was riddled with unused land. One reader wrote: “Farming land in black hands all over the EC is not being used. Farming is not hereditary. The next generation must take an interest in it or else the efforts of the previous generation go to waste. It's no surprise that it's the same with Madiba's farms.”
