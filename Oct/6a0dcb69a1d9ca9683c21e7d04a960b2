The Buffalo City Metro beauty pageant's 2019 edition was launched at a glittering ceremony at East London's Hemingways Mall on Saturday. The pageant will take place at the Orient Theatre on November 16, said organiser Vuyelwa Nqweniso. The 20 finalists — 10 males and 10 females — were each given two minutes to share their vision. Nqweniso said the pageant was not only about beauty, but also about self development. “We want to give them financial literacy and teach them how to start a business from scratch and grow it.” She said one of the entry requirements was a Grade 12 certificate, because “we want to encourage them to prioritise their schooling”. Another pageant partner, Vuyo Ngqase, said as part of event, the contestants would attend a week-long entrepreneurship workshop. “They will do entrepreneurship excursions where they will visit business establishments within the metro. “We want to expose them to the business sector; for them to learn how to run a business and how to convert an idea into business,” Ngqase said. He said all the contestants would gain something through the pageant, whether they won or not. “We want to prepare them for the real world. When we are done with this pageant, we want them to go back to their communities, having the knowledge of how to become a successful business person,” he said. Miss Buffalo City Metro 2018, Thimna Qakwane, said she had managed to positively contribute in some areas around the metro after she won the crown. “Winning the pageant gave me a great platform to make my mark,” she said. Among many things Qakwane did was to help a Ndevana-based women’s co-op that grows vegetables. “But my highlight was to go around schools in the metro teaching young girls how to carry themselves,” she said. sinom@dispatch.co.za
