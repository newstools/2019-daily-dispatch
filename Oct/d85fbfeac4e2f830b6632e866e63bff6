Another drowned body has been discovered. This time on the rocks at Nahoon Corner in East London. The body is believed to be that of the second teenager presumed drowned on Sunday after two teenagers were washed out to see while swimming at Eastern Beach. The body was discovered by a surfer at the popular surf spot. Another body was found in the water at Mermaid's Pool in Nahoon, East London on Tuesday and is thought to be the other missing teenager. The incident, in which three teenagers on a school tour from Middelburg were seen struggling in the rip current, took place just after 8am on Sunday morning. One of the three youngsters was rescued by local surfers, but despite an extensive sea and shoreline searchÂ  by NSRI, firefighters, a BCM dive unit, police divers and K9 search and rescue units along the coast, there was no sign of the other two. Positive identification of the bodies has not yet been made.
