The Democratic Alliance has been ordered by the East London High Court to pay for damages to a female former member who sued the party for R10m over a 'toilet' interview in 2016. The party will also pay her legal costs after losing the defamation case which has dragged on for three years. Ntombenhle Hulumeni took the party to court in 2016 after she was interviewed inside the toilets of the East London Golf Course for a council position on February 6 2016. Delivering the judgment, Nozuko Mjali said: “There is no doubt in my mind that the plaintiff was deeply hurt and felt unfairly treated by the agents of her own organisation even before the interview that was held inside the female ablution area at the Bunkers Hill Golf Course.” The controversial interview took place inside female toilets where DA male MP Kevin Mileham was in the interview panel alongside female MP Terri Stander and another female party member. While Judge Mjali agreed that Hulumeni suffered injury to her personality, she however dismissed her claim of loss of income for losing the councillor post she was interviewed for. A date will be announced for the two parties to argue over the value of the payment for damages. DA provincial leader Nqaba Banga told DispatchLIVE: “The party is going to study the judgment and we might consider a decision to appeal but the federal committee will have to meet to decide.”
