 Police in East London have launched a huge hunt for six heavily-armed men who broke into three Hemingways mall stores late on Sunday night and made off with stock worth hundreds of thousands of rands. Mall spokesperson Reinette van Tonder said electronics including cellphones and laptops had been the main target. The daring break-in took five minutes, said Van Tonder. The mall's CCTV footage shows the balaclava-clad men bashing the glass doors of  cellphone shop Cellucity and the Multiserv and Side Step stores before dragging away heavy bags with their haul. The footage shows that the incident took place at 11.29pm. Cambridge police spokesperson Captain Mluleki Mbi said the men used crowbars and big hammers to break the glass doors. Van Tonder said: “Guards were at their posts and were warned to take extreme caution as the perpetrators were armed, and that an armed Fidelity patrol vehicle and the SAPS flying squad was on the way. “Noteworthy is that it took a mere five minutes from detection and breach of the locked mall door to exiting with the loot.” A store manager said  the robbers had unplugged a till at Multiserv and left with it after failing to open it. Mbi confirmed a till had been stolen from the store. The stock stolen at Cellucity – including the latest iPhones and other gadgets – arrived only on Saturday, a source said. Police said the men had sped off in a white BMW sedan.
