The boys of Selborne College’s Xhosa Society have rallied together to raise R30,000 to renovate Southernwood Primary School’s kitchen. The funds have also been used to extend the primary school’s tuck shop. The Xhosa Society raised half the amount in 2018, and the remainder in 2019. Xhosa Society chairperson Kungayo Xuma said: “Our society has been doing charity work for years now. We raise funds through cultural evenings and market and civvies days.” In 2019, they decided to bring the initiative closer to home, as in the past they had raised funds for schools on the outskirts of East London, including some in Mdantsane. “Last year, we decided on Southernwood Primary. “We chose this school because it is one of those that educates those less fortunate in our community. “The Xhosas have a saying that it takes a village to raise a child, and as the Selborne Xhosa Society we want to encourage the rest of the East London community to follow suit.” Southernwood Primary acting principal Brendon Hendricks expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Selborne pupils. “We are eternally grateful to the Xhosa Society for nominating us as beneficiaries. “The funds went a long way in helping us to better our school,” he said. Hendricks said staff had made a decision among themselves on what to spend the money on. “A decision was made to first renovate the kitchen in 2018. “This year we extended our tuck shop which was quite small,” said Hendricks. Teacher in charge of the Xhosa Society, Nolwandle Mnwana-Mini, said: “With the support of our stakeholders we decided it was time to cater for our surroundings. “I’d like to thank our headmaster, Andrew Dewar, for allowing us to continue with this programme. “It is important to always keep pupils motivated to do the right thing and warm people’s hearts with the good deeds they do,” said Mnwana-Mini anelisam@dispatch.co.za
