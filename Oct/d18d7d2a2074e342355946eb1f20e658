Three-quarters (75%) of battery storage from renewable-energy plants in the country will be located in the Western Cape, Eskom told parliament's standing committee on finance, economic opportunities and tourism on Wednesday. As part of a loan agreement with the World Bank, Eskom has committed to installing a number of clean-energy projects in SA, 75% of which will be in the Western Cape as it is the only province that meets the loanâ€™s stringent criteria of infrastructure quality. The DA has used these facts as an opportunity to say the move is proof of the quality of governance under a DA-led Western Cape government, which the party says stimulates industry and fosters greater trade, growth and innovation for its residents.
