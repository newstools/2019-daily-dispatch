Thirty- five schools which were closed due to a road protest in Ngqeleni have been reopened, Eastern Cape education MEC Fundile Gade said. Almost 17,000 pupils from 50 villages were made to sit at home for three weeks after residents closed the road demanding that the road from Ntlaza to Hluleka Nature Reserve be tarred. The schools had been closed since September 30. In a statement, Gade said an interdepartmental co-operation and partnership between the departments of Education and Transport has finally resulted in a brokered deal. “These engagements between government and the community, demonstrates the commitment of the provincial government in resolving urgent matters that confront our communities. “We have been able to intervene in ensuring that learners from all schools including the 367 Grade 12 learners from the five affected high schools are back in class. We have called upon the circuit to work with these schools to ensure that all our learners have a clear plan of revision. This will assist the learners to continue to prepare for their final examinations.”
