Straight after their maths exam on Friday, a group of matric pupils from Clarendon Girls High School brought joy to 35 other children when they donated a prefab classroom at the Global Mercy Missions Pre-School in Stoney Drift. Fundraising initiatives contributed R40,000, while the girls also received R30,000 from East London company Gridnic Agencies. Clarendon matric Kuhle Hloma said: “We saw people who needed help and we could not just sit around while people suffer. We tried to get people to donate money and hosted events at school so that we could  help those who are less fortunate.” Her sentiments were echoed by peer Velintle Manzana. “Not everyone has access to resources that some of us have. Everyone should give back because there are a lot of people who are needy in our communities.” Gridnic’s Shelby Moyes said it was “amazing” to assist a project initiated by her alma mater. “We have been in contact with the school about this charity. We decided to help to make a bigger classroom which would be more beneficial to the school and the community,” she said. “It is so amazing. We know the struggle some children have to have proper classrooms, so giving back to this community gives us something to feel good about.” Global Mercy Missions principal Sherylene Minter said the school, opened in 2015, started as a feeding scheme in the community. “We have seen amazing growth. The children are thriving, we feed them and also feed the community. Clarendon and Gridnic have been fantastic. They took it upon themselves to bless us with this new classroom. All the other classrooms are shacks — this is our first real structure,” she said. bhongoj@tisoblackstar.co.za
