The 30-year-old man accused of killing Angelique Clark-Abrahams, 25, told the East London magistrate’s court that he had hired a new lawyer for his bail application. The man, who is accused of killing Clark-Abrahams in front of her child, was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on November 6. Speaking in a baritone, calm and seemingly unfazed tone, the accused told magistrate Annemarie Elliot that he had not consulted with his new lawyer. Elliot told him he was remanded pending a decision by the director of public prosecutions and for him to consult his new lawyer. The accused faces charges of rape and murder. He was arrested in August after Clark-Abrahams was assaulted and subsequently admitted to Cecilia Makiwane hospital’s ICU, where she died weeks later. Outside the court, the SA Women Fight Back organisation picketed before handing over a no-bail petition with 28,000 signatures from 26 countries. Leader of the group, Niki Bouws, from East London, who started the online petition while Clark-Abrahams was still alive, said: “I felt pressed to get it up and running to protect her and her son. “We are very excited about the support we have garnered from all over the world. “We will be here on the November 6 but this time inside the court.” Activist Sherry Scholtz said: “We want justice for Angie and all women across SA who are victims of gender-based violence. “Government should meet us halfway.” The death of Clark-Abrahams sent shockwaves across the country and prompted President Cyril Ramaphosa to visit her family and those of slain UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana and boxing and karate champion Leighandre “Baby Lee” Jegels. Clark-Abrahams had obtained a protection order against a man, court evidence showed. The attack allegedly took place at her home in Buffalo Flats. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
