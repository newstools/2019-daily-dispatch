Rideshare service Uber will be launching in East London on Thursday. The rollout of the cheaper UberGO option in East London makes it the sixth South African city to offer Uber. Rival service Bolt, formerly Taxify, already operates in East London. Uber is calling all existing transport operators to sign up with Uber via uber.com. On Saturday, a dedicated support centre for drivers will be launched at Hamilton Club, 1 Clevedon Road, East London. Uber’s country manager for SA, Nduduzo Nyanda, said: “In the last year, we have seen the Uber app opened over 100,000 times in East London, which is a clear indication that there is a high demand to use the app. “The way people move and work in their cities is changing, and we see positive regulatory momentum for ride-sharing across South Africa. “We are partnering with cities throughout South Africa to address their growing transport needs and to shape the future of urban mobility.” Buffalo City Metropolitan Development Agency said it was excited to welcome Uber to the city. “We are thrilled that our citizens will benefit as we become one of the many smart cities in South Africa that will now have access to Uber’s technology that can help improve the first- and last-mile journeys of passengers,” it said. johnh@dispatch.co.za
