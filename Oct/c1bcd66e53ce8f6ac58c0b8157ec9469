Axed Algoa FM DJ Daron Mann took to social media on Monday to implore his fans to refrain from protesting at the radio station's offices. “That radio station was my life for almost 28 years, many dear friends still work there as does my beloved daughter. “Please don't let my name there be remembered for that,” Mann said. He asked that supporters rather donate to animal shelters or volunteer for worthy charities.
